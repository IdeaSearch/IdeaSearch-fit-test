This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"

The target variable `x` is the oscillator's position, which has units of meters (`m`).\n\nA critical examination of the provided information reveals two key challenges with applying the standard textbook model for a damped oscillator:\n\n1.  **The Overdamping Problem**: The standard formula for displacement, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2) * t + phi)`, is only valid for the underdamped case (`omega > gamma`). When damping is strong (`gamma > omega`), the term inside the square root becomes negative, leading to computational errors (NaN) in a real-number environment. A robust model must gracefully handle all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\n\n2.  **The Positive Output Contradiction**: The observed output range for `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the position is always positive. However, a simple oscillator's displacement `x(t)` should oscillate around an equilibrium point (typically zero), taking on both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical process is not a simple oscillation about a fixed zero point. The always-positive nature of the displacement points towards two possibilities: either the target is the *magnitude* of the displacement, or the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, non-zero baseline. The latter presents a more physically intuitive and mathematically smooth model.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the system represents an oscillator whose equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. The overall position `x(t)` is the sum of this decaying baseline and a damped oscillation around it. This model can be conceptualized as an object that is both settling (sinking) in a viscous medium and oscillating as it does so.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this process would be:\n`x(t) = Position_baseline(t) + Position_oscillation(t)`\n\nBoth processes are subject to the same damping environment. Therefore, it is logical to assume they share the same exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The oscillatory part has an amplitude proportional to the input `A` and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. The baseline position can also be scaled relative to `A`.\n\nThis leads to a model of the form:\n`x(t) = [A_baseline + A_oscillation * cos(omega * t + phi)] * exp(-gamma * t)`\n\nBy making the baseline amplitude `A_baseline` sufficiently larger than the oscillation amplitude `A_oscillation`, the total position `x(t)` will remain positive for all `t`. We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\n\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\n\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \"yield\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time. This is described by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, assuming for simplicity a zero initial phase for the oscillatory part.\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A`, we arrive at a concise model that not only explains the non-zero mean and large peak values but also grounds the magnitude of the equilibrium shift in the fundamental physics of the oscillator's dissipative and conservative properties.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma / omega) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"

Two key observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism: first, the output `x` is always positive, and second, its maximum value can substantially exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nMy theoretical analysis is based on the concept of a **\"displaced and co-decaying equilibrium\"**. I propose that the event initiating the motion does not simply impart energy for oscillation but also causes an instantaneous, significant shift in the system's equilibrium position. This displaced equilibrium point is not static; it is a transient feature. The physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillations (e.g., friction, air resistance), quantified by `gamma`, also acts to restore this equilibrium point to its original state (zero).\n\nConsequently, the decay of the equilibrium offset and the decay of the oscillation amplitude are not independent processes but are governed by the same underlying dissipative force. They share the same characteristic decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components, both modulated by a single, overarching decay factor:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard simple harmonic motion term, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's oscillation relative to its (moving) equilibrium. `param1` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Offset Component**: This is a constant term, `param2`, which represents the magnitude of the initial equilibrium displacement, normalized by the initial amplitude `A`.

The structure `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(...) + param2)` elegantly captures this. If `param2` is a positive constant greater than 1, the term `(cos(...) + param2)` will always be positive, thus ensuring `x(t)` is always positive, consistent with the data. Furthermore, at early times (t≈0), the output can be approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which readily explains why the observed displacement can be much larger than `A`.\n\nThis model is both parsimonious and physically intuitive. It describes a system knocked off-center, where both the oscillation around this new center and the center's return to origin are damped by the same physical process.

        "fuzzy_enlightor": "### Theoretical Analysis\n\nA preliminary analysis of the input variables (`A`, `gamma`, `omega`, `t`) and the target variable `x` points to the physics of a damped harmonic oscillator. However, a simple model of the form `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` is fundamentally insufficient. The data reveals that the maximum output displacement (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), and the mean displacement is substantially positive (8.28). This indicates that the system's equilibrium position is not at zero.\n\nI propose a theory centered on **energy-dissipation-induced equilibrium shift**. In an ideal oscillator, energy is conserved. In this system, the damping term `gamma` signifies that energy is continuously being removed. My hypothesis is that this dissipated energy performs work on the system's environment or internal structure, causing a permanent, non-oscillatory displacement. The observed motion `x(t)` is therefore a superposition of two distinct physical processes:\n1.  A standard damped oscillation about the initial equilibrium (zero).\n2.  A monotonic, time-varying shift of the equilibrium position itself, driven by the cumulative energy lost from the oscillatory mode.\n\nLet's model these two components. The standard oscillation is well-described by `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. This term correctly reflects the initial displacement being `A` at `t=0` (assuming zero initial phase). For the total displacement `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_offset(t)` to satisfy the initial condition `x(0) = A`, the offset term `x_offset(t)` must be zero at `t=0`.\n\nThe core of my theory lies in the formulation of this offset.\nFirst, consider the **time evolution** of the shift. If the shift is driven by energy dissipation, its temporal profile should mirror the cumulative energy loss. The energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude, so it decays as `(exp(-gamma * t))^2 = exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. The cumulative energy dissipated from the start until time `t` is therefore proportional to `(1 - exp(-2 * gamma * t))`. This provides a physically motivated functional form for the offset's evolution, distinct from the amplitude's decay rate.\n\nSecond, consider the **magnitude of the final equilibrium shift**. This shift is not a universal constant but a property of the specific system, determined by the interplay between its dissipative (`gamma`) and oscillatory (`omega`) characteristics. The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega` serves as a key parameter describing the damping regime. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the final offset is a saturating function of this ratio. A system with very low damping (`gamma/omega` -> 0) might not generate a significant permanent shift, and the effect should not grow infinitely as damping increases. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate to model this saturation.\n\nCombining these elements, the offset term is modeled as:\n`x_offset(t) = X_final * (1 - exp(-2 * gamma * t))`\nwhere the final equilibrium position `X_final` is given by:\n`X_final = A * param1 * tanh(param2 * gamma / omega)`\n\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor representing the maximum possible offset relative to the initial amplitude `A`, and `param2` is another dimensionless parameter that controls the sensitivity of the offset to the damping ratio. The entire expression is scaled by `A` to ensure the final model has the correct units of displacement (meters).\n\nSuperimposing the oscillatory and offset components yields the complete model. This theory provides a self-consistent physical picture: an initial oscillation loses energy, and this very energy loss creates a new, stable equilibrium, with the dynamics of this process governed by the fundamental properties of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(param2 * gamma / omega) * (1 - exp(-2 * gamma * t)) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"
