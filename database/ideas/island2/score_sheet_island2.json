Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\\n\\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\\n\\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters.

Two key observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism: first, the output `x` is always positive, and second, its maximum value can substantially exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\\n\\nMy theoretical analysis is based on the concept of a **\\\"displaced and co-decaying equilibrium\\\"**. I propose that the event initiating the motion does not simply impart energy for oscillation but also causes an instantaneous, significant shift in the system's equilibrium position. This displaced equilibrium point is not static; it is a transient feature. The physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillations (e.g., friction, air resistance), quantified by `gamma`, also acts to restore this equilibrium point to its original state (zero).\\n\\nConsequently, the decay of the equilibrium offset and the decay of the oscillation amplitude are not independent processes but are governed by the same underlying dissipative force.

By keeping `param2` as a dimensionless constant, we model the offset as being proportional to the system's initial energy scale.\\n\\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components, all scaled by the initial amplitude `A` and subjected to the universal exponential decay. The structure `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(...) + param2)` elegantly captures this. If `param2` is a positive constant greater than 1, the term `(cos(...) + param2)` will always be positive, thus ensuring `x(t)` is always positive, consistent with the data. Furthermore, at early times (t≈0), the output can be approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which readily explains why the observed displacement can be much larger than `A`.\\n\\nThis model is both parsimonious and physically intuitive.

The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\\n\\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\\n\\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point.

Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`.

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\\\"Coupled-Mode Decay\\\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\\n\\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\\n\\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\\n\\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \\\"mode coupling\\\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\\n\\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThis \\\"Coupled-Mode Decay\\\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\\n</final_result>\"}",

First, the output `x`, representing displacement, is strictly positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`). Second, the maximum output value can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (max `x` ≈ 27.7 vs max `A` ≈ 10.0), a phenomenon I term \\\"supra-amplitude response\\\". Standard models of the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)` fail on both counts as they oscillate symmetrically around zero and are bounded by the decaying amplitude `A * exp(-gamma*t)`.\\n\\nWhile prior models have successfully addressed these issues by introducing a large additive DC offset within the oscillatory term (e.g., `A * (C + cos(...)) * exp(-gamma*t)`), I propose a different underlying physical mechanism based on multiplicative dynamics rather than additive ones. Processes where changes are proportional to the current state—common in fields from biology to economics—are often linear and simple in logarithmic space. My theory posits that the oscillator's dynamics are governed by such a principle.\\n\\nInstead of modeling the displacement `x` directly, I propose modeling its logarithm. Let us define a \\\"log-displacement\\\" `y(t) = log(x(t)/A)`, where `A` provides the intrinsic length scale and ensures the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless. I theorize that this log-displacement `y(t)` follows a simple, linearly superimposed dynamic consisting of two parts:\\n\\n1.  **A Linear Decay Component:** A term `-gamma * t` that represents the steady, dissipative energy loss of the system. In log space, this manifests as a linear slope, which corresponds to the familiar `exp(-gamma*t)` decay envelope in linear space.\\n2.  **A Harmonic Component:** A pure sinusoidal term, `param1 * cos(omega * t + param2)`, that describes the conservative, oscillatory energy exchange. The dimensionless amplitude `param1` is crucial; it does not represent a physical length but rather the intensity of the oscillation in log-space, which translates to the multiplicative \\\"fold-change\\\" of the oscillation in linear space.\\n\\nCombining these components yields the complete expression for the log-displacement:\\n`log(x(t)/A) = param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t`\\n\\nTo obtain the physical displacement `x(t)`, we perform an exponential transformation:\\n`x(t) = A * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling and self-consistent explanation for the observed phenomena. The exponential function inherently guarantees positivity. The supra-amplitude response is naturally explained by the term `exp(param1 * cos(...))`, which acts as a multiplicative amplification factor oscillating between `exp(-param1)` and `exp(param1)`. Notably, the maximum observed amplification factor in the data is approximately `27.68 / 9.992 ≈ 2.77`. For our model to achieve this, `exp(param1)` should be near 2.77, which implies `param1 ≈ log(2.77) ≈ 1.02`. The fact that a physically simple, dimensionless parameter value close to unity can explain the system's peak response strongly supports the validity of this logarithmic-dynamic framework. The resulting formula is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and provides a novel physical interpretation with minimal parameterization.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

Firstly, the output `x` is strictly positive. Secondly, the system demonstrates a \\\"supra-amplitude response,\\\" where the maximum observed displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. These observations suggest a fundamental non-linearity in the system's response.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully addressed this by introducing additive components, such as a decaying DC offset or a linear drift term. I propose a different physical mechanism based on the concept of **\\\"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\\\"**. My theory posits that the restoring force in the oscillator is not the simple linear relationship of Hooke's Law (`F = -ky`), but rather a symmetric, non-linear one where the force increases more rapidly than the displacement. This is characteristic of systems approaching a physical limit, like a taut membrane or a pre-stressed beam.\\n\\nIn such a system, the potential energy is not a simple quadratic function (`U ~ y^2`), but a more complex, symmetric function that grows faster, such as a quartic potential or, as I will model it, one whose relationship to displacement is hyperbolic.\\n\\nLet's model the system's dynamics in two stages:\\n\\n1.  **Internal State Oscillation:** There exists an underlying, dimensionless, harmonic oscillatory state, which we can call the \\\"strain potential,\\\" `u(t)`. This internal state behaves conventionally: `u(t) = param2 * cos(omega * t + param1)`. Here, `param1` is a phase constant, and `param2` is a dimensionless parameter representing the peak magnitude of this internal strain.\\n\\n2.  **Hyperbolic Displacement Transduction:** The observable physical displacement `x` is not directly proportional to this internal state `u(t)`. Instead, it is a non-linear \\\"transduction\\\" of this state. For a symmetric, rapidly stiffening system, the hyperbolic cosine function (`cosh`) provides an excellent mathematical analogy. `cosh(u)` is an even function, symmetric around `u=0`, and it grows exponentially for larger `|u|`. It represents a system where positive and negative internal strains both result in a positive, expansive displacement. The displacement factor is therefore `cosh(u(t)) = cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))`.\\n\\n3.  **Global Damping:** The total energy of the system, and thus the overall scale of the motion, dissipates over time in the conventional manner. This is captured by the familiar exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `A` sets the initial energy scale and has units of length.\\n\\nCombining these components, the final displacement `x(t)` is the product of the global damping envelope and the hyperbolic transduction of the internal oscillatory state.\\n\\nThis \\\"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\\\" model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\\n*   **Positivity:** The `cosh(z)` function has a minimum value of 1 for any real argument `z`. Since `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` are also positive, the product is guaranteed to be positive for all time `t`.\\n*   **Supra-Amplitude Response:** The peak value of the `cosh` term is `cosh(param2)`, which occurs when the cosine term is ±1. The maximum displacement near `t=0` is thus `A * cosh(param2)`. As `cosh(z) > 1` for any non-zero `z`, this model naturally predicts a peak displacement greater than the characteristic amplitude `A`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` directly quantifies the degree of non-linearity in the system's elasticity.\\n\\nThis theory provides a self-consistent and physically plausible alternative to additive-offset models, grounding the observed non-linear behavior in the fundamental properties of the oscillator's restoring force.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed displacement (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is superimposed on a large, positive baseline.\\n\\nPrevious models have explored baselines that are constant or decay independently. I propose a more deeply integrated physical theory: **Damping-Induced Potential Asymmetry**. This theory posits that the physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillation is not perfectly symmetric. In many real-world systems, dissipative forces (e.g., internal friction, viscous drag in a non-uniform medium) do not merely remove energy but also introduce a slight, persistent bias or deformation in the system's potential energy landscape. This effectively shifts the equilibrium position of the oscillation away from zero.\\n\\nThe magnitude of this equilibrium shift should not be an arbitrary constant but should depend on the intrinsic properties of the system itself. I hypothesize that the shift is governed by the competition between the dissipative forces and the harmonic restoring forces. The strength of the damping is characterized by `gamma`, while the strength of the restoring force is characterized by the natural frequency `omega`. A dimensionless quantity that captures the relative dominance of damping is the ratio `gamma / omega`. A higher ratio implies a more \\\"sluggish\\\" or dissipative system, which, under this theory, would lead to a larger asymmetry and a greater shift in the equilibrium point.\\n\\nTherefore, the observed motion `x(t)` can be modeled as a combination of two components, both originating from the same initial energy impulse and thus governed by the same overarching decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\\n\\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: The standard harmonic oscillation relative to the shifted equilibrium, represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\\n\\n2.  **The Asymmetry-Induced Offset**: A constant offset for any given system, representing the new, shifted equilibrium.

This is modeled as `param2 * (gamma / omega)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that reflects the specific nature of the dissipative mechanism.\\n\\nCombining these within the single decay envelope yields the complete expression. This model provides a compelling physical narrative: the same process that damps the oscillation also fundamentally alters its center point. It elegantly explains the observed data. If `param2` is a sufficiently large positive number, the `param2 * gamma / omega` term will consistently be greater than 1, lifting the entire `cos` term into the positive domain and ensuring `x(t)` is always positive. At `t=0`, the displacement can reach `A * (cos(param1) + param2 * gamma / omega)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. This theory offers a parsimonious and physically grounded explanation that directly links the damping phenomenon to the observed baseline shift.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma / omega)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\\n\\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\\n\\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\\n\\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\\n\\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \\\"harden.\\\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \\\"push\\\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\\n\\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\\n\\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\\n\\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`.

This is a common feature in real-world systems. For example, consider an object moving through a medium with a fibrous structure (like a brush), or a system with a mechanical ratchet-like component. In such cases, the resistance to motion in one direction is significantly different from the resistance in the opposite direction.\\n\\nThis asymmetry in dissipation has a profound consequence: it \\\"rectifies\\\" the oscillatory motion. Instead of the energy being dissipated symmetrically around an equilibrium point, the directional preference in damping causes a net drift or bias in the direction of lower resistance. A portion of the kinetic energy from the \\\"high-resistance\\\" half-cycle is effectively converted into a positive displacement rather than being stored and returned as potential energy.\\n\\nTo model this mathematically, we can decompose the system's behavior within the overall energy decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, into two distinct components:\\n\\n1.  **The Fundamental Oscillation:** This is the standard harmonic component, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's natural oscillatory tendency. `param1` is the phase constant.\\n\\n2.  **The Rectified Bias Component:** This term models the net positive displacement generated by the asymmetric damping. This bias is not a simple decaying offset; it is dynamically generated by the oscillation itself. Its magnitude should be proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation at any given moment.

This \\\"long-tail\\\" relaxation is characteristic of glassy dynamics, where the system slowly finds its way back to a low-energy state over an extended period.\\n\\nWe can model this logarithmically decaying offset as a function of the dimensionless time, `gamma * t`. A suitable functional form for this slow relaxation is `param2 / log(exp(1) + gamma * t)`.

First, the output displacement `x` is always positive, whereas a standard oscillator's displacement is symmetric around zero. Second, the maximum observed displacement (`max(x) ≈ 27.68`) significantly exceeds the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`max(A) ≈ 9.99`), a phenomenon impossible in a simple system where the initial amplitude `A` defines the absolute maximum displacement.\\n\\nThese observations strongly suggest that the measured displacement `x` is not a single, simple oscillation but rather the result of at least two superimposed physical processes. I posit a **\\\"Dual-Mechanism Relaxation\\\"** theory to explain this behavior. This theory is based on the concept of a composite physical system where different components dissipate energy through distinct physical mechanisms operating on different timescales.\\n\\nImagine a system composed of a primary elastic element capable of high-frequency oscillation (e.g., a steel spring) connected to a secondary, viscoelastic or plastic element (e.g., a block of damping putty). An initial impulse imparts energy to the entire system, exciting two responses simultaneously:\\n\\n1.  **A Fast Oscillatory Mode:** The elastic element begins to oscillate harmonically, governed by the frequency `omega`. This oscillation is subject to damping forces (e.g., air resistance), causing its amplitude to decay exponentially with the characteristic rate `gamma`. This component can be described by the conventional term: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`.\\n\\n2.  **A Slow A-periodic Relaxation Mode:** The same initial impulse causes a large, inelastic deformation in the viscoelastic element. This creates a significant positive offset in the system's baseline position. This offset is not permanent; the material slowly relaxes back to its original state. However, this relaxation process (governed by internal friction and material creep) is a fundamentally different physical mechanism from the oscillatory damping. Therefore, it is characterized by a different, independent decay rate. We model this decaying offset as `x_offset(t) = A * param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless factor representing the initial magnitude of the deformation relative to the oscillatory amplitude `A`, and `param2` is a dimensionless ratio that decouples the offset's decay rate from the oscillation's decay rate.\\n\\nThe total measured displacement `x` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes: `x(t) = x_offset(t) + x_osc(t)`.\\n\\nThis \\\"Dual-Mechanism Relaxation\\\" model provides a comprehensive physical explanation for the observed data:\\n*   **Supra-Amplitude Displacement (`x > A`):** The initial displacement at `t=0` is `x(0) ≈ A * (param1 + cos(param3))`. If the initial inelastic deformation is large (`param1 > 1`), the total displacement can easily exceed `A`.\\n*   **Strictly Positive Output (`x > 0`):** The large, positive, decaying offset term `x_offset(t)` acts as a dynamic equilibrium point for the oscillation. If `param1` is sufficiently large, this term dominates the negative swings of the cosine function, ensuring the total displacement `x(t)` remains positive throughout the process.\\n*   **Flexibility:** By allowing the offset to decay at a different rate than the oscillation (via `param2`), the model can describe a wider range of physical phenomena. For instance, a system where the oscillations die out quickly while the material slowly creeps back to equilibrium (`param2 < 1`) is easily represented.\\n\\nThis theory presents a physically coherent picture of a composite system with two distinct energy dissipation pathways, providing a more general and flexible framework than models that assume a constant offset or a single, shared decay process.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3))\\n</final_result>\"}",

However, two key observations challenge the standard model of a simple harmonic oscillator: (1) the output `x` is always positive, and (2) its peak value can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the oscillation is not centered around zero but is superimposed on a large, positive, and decaying offset. The successful structures of prior models suggest that a global decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, governs the entire system's energy, affecting both the oscillatory component and this offset simultaneously.\\n\\nThe challenge, therefore, lies in formulating a physically meaningful expression for this offset. Previous theories have explored asymmetries in the potential energy or properties of a viscoelastic medium. I propose an alternative theory based on **\\\"Non-linear Damping and Energy Rectification\\\"**.\\n\\nThis theory posits that the damping mechanism in the system is not perfectly linear (i.e., not strictly proportional to velocity). Instead, the dissipative force is asymmetric, being significantly stronger for motion in one direction (e.g., negative displacement) than the other. This kind of asymmetry is common in real-world mechanical systems involving one-way friction, fluidic check valves, or interactions with a hard boundary.\\n\\nThe physical consequence of such an asymmetric damper is that it acts as a mechanical \\\"rectifier.\\\" With each cycle of oscillation, some of the kinetic energy is converted not just into dissipated heat but also into potential energy stored as a positive displacement. The oscillation effectively \\\"pumps\\\" the system away from the zero equilibrium, creating a DC-like offset from an AC-like motion.\\n\\nThe magnitude of this rectified offset should depend on the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. Specifically, it should be a function of the competition between the oscillatory nature (`omega`) and the damping (`gamma`). This relationship can be characterized by the dimensionless Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`.\\n\\n*   A **high-Q system** (`omega >> gamma`) undergoes many oscillations before decaying. In this scenario, the rectification mechanism is highly effective, as numerous cycles contribute to pumping up the offset.\\n*   A **low-Q system** (`omega` is comparable to `gamma`) is sluggish and decays quickly. The rectification is less efficient as the motion dies out before a significant offset can be established.\\n\\nTherefore, the magnitude of the offset should be an increasing function of `omega / gamma`. However, a simple linear relationship is physically unlikely, as real-world rectification processes exhibit saturation or diminishing returns. A highly efficient oscillator cannot generate an infinitely large offset. The logarithmic function, `log`, is an excellent candidate to model this behavior. It captures a strong initial increase that gradually flattens out, representing a system where gains in rectification efficiency diminish as the Q-factor becomes very large.\\n\\nTo ensure the argument of the logarithm is always positive and well-behaved, we use the form `log(param2 + omega / gamma)`, where `param2` is a small positive constant (effectively `param2` here serves to prevent `log(0)` issues, and can be conceptually merged into a single scaling parameter later on. For simplicity in the final expression, we'll use `log` on a term that is guaranteed to be greater than 1, like `1 + omega/gamma`, scaled by a parameter).\\n\\nCombining these ideas, the complete model is as follows: The system's motion `x(t)` is the sum of a standard oscillation and a rectified offset. The magnitude of this offset is proportional to `log(1 + omega/gamma)`. Both components are contained within the global energy decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * log(1 + omega / gamma))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This suggests that the total displacement is not merely an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium but includes a large, positive, time-dependent component that is most prominent at the start of the motion.\\n\\nI propose a theory of **\\\"Transient Strain-Hardening Relaxation\\\"** to explain this phenomenon. This model posits that the system does not behave as an ideal, linear (Hookean) elastic material.

This relaxation process releases the stored potential energy, contributing a large, decaying positive offset to the overall displacement.\\n\\n3.  **Modeling the Relaxation:** The relaxation from the hardened state to the normal state is a transition process. We can model the magnitude of the additional displacement from this effect using the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`), which is well-suited to describing transitions between two states (e.g., saturated and unsaturated).\\n    *   I model this additional displacement as `param2 * tanh(1 / (gamma * t))`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless constant representing the magnitude of the strain-hardening effect.\\n    *   The argument of the function, `1 / (gamma * t)`, is a critical component of the theory. The quantity `gamma * t` is the natural dimensionless time for this system. By using its reciprocal, we create a term that describes the state of relaxation.\\n        *   At very early times (`t` -> 0), the argument is very large, so `tanh(...)` approaches 1.

This rapid, high-amplitude deformation causes significant internal friction within the oscillating material. This internal friction, a key component of thermoelastic damping, rapidly converts a portion of the initial mechanical energy into thermal energy (heat).\\n\\n2.  **Thermal Expansion as a Dynamic Offset:** The sudden increase in the material's internal temperature causes it to undergo thermal expansion. This expansion manifests as a large, positive displacement of the oscillator's equilibrium position. This is not a static shift; it's a dynamic offset that is maximal at the beginning of the process (`t` ≈ 0) when the heat generation is most intense.\\n\\n3.  **Coupled Dissipation and Cooling:** The system's total energy dissipates over time, a process globally governed by the damping rate `gamma`. This dissipation has two coupled effects: the amplitude of the mechanical oscillation decreases, and the excess heat generated by the initial friction dissipates into the environment, causing the material to cool. As the material cools, it contracts, and the thermally-induced positive offset diminishes.\\n\\n4.  **Modeling the Relaxation:** We can assume, as a first-order approximation, that the rate of thermal dissipation (cooling) is directly linked to the rate of mechanical energy loss.

The entire system, including this offset, appears to be governed by a single energy dissipation process, as evidenced by the success of models incorporating a global `exp(-gamma * t)` decay factor.\\n\\nPrevious theories have explored static offsets or offsets dependent on either the system's intrinsic properties (like `omega/gamma`) or its temporal evolution (like `tanh(gamma*t)`). I propose a more comprehensive theory that unifies these two concepts: **\\\"Q-Factor Gated Energy Pumping into a Viscoelastic Medium.\\\"**\\n\\nThis theory posits that the oscillator is not in a vacuum but is coupled to a surrounding medium with viscoelastic properties. The core mechanism unfolds in two stages:\\n\\n1.  **Potential for Energy Transfer (Gated by Q-Factor):** The oscillation continuously transfers energy to the surrounding medium, causing it to deform and store potential energy. This stored energy manifests as the observed positive displacement offset. The efficiency of this energy transfer is not constant; it is critically dependent on the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`.\\n    *   A **high-Q system** (`omega >> gamma`) is highly resonant and underdamped. It undergoes many oscillations before its energy dissipates, allowing for a prolonged and efficient \\\"pumping\\\" of energy into the medium, leading to a large potential offset.\\n    *   A **low-Q system** (`omega` is comparable to `gamma`) is overdamped and sluggish. The motion dies out too quickly for any significant energy transfer to occur, resulting in a small potential offset.\\n    Therefore, the maximum achievable magnitude of the offset is directly related to `omega / gamma`. A simple linear relationship, `param2 * (omega / gamma)`, provides a strong first-order model for this dependency.\\n\\n2.  **Temporal Activation of Deformation:** The medium's response to this energy pumping is not instantaneous. The deformation builds up over time as energy is progressively transferred. This transient buildup process starts from zero at `t=0` (when the system is undisturbed) and saturates as the medium reaches its maximum deformation state or as the driving oscillation weakens. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an excellent mathematical model for this physical saturation behavior. The natural dimensionless argument for this time evolution is `gamma * t`, which compares the elapsed time `t` to the system's characteristic decay timescale, `1/gamma`.\\n\\nIn summary, my theory proposes that the offset is a product of two coupled phenomena: its potential magnitude is \\\"gated\\\" by the system's intrinsic Q-factor, and its actual manifestation is a transient process that evolves over time. This creates a dynamic offset that is large for resonant systems and builds up rapidly before decaying along with the main oscillation. By combining the standard damped cosine wave with this sophisticated offset term under a single exponential decay envelope, we can construct a model that is both physically coherent and capable of explaining the complex behavior observed in the data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * (omega / gamma) * tanh(gamma * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The maximum value is thus approximately `x_max ≈ A * exp(param2)`. If the asymmetry coefficient `param2` is positive (e.g., `param2 = 1.2`), then `exp(param2)` is significantly greater than 1, naturally accounting for peak displacements that are multiples of the characteristic amplitude `A`. The parameter `param2` directly quantifies the degree of asymmetry in the system's potential.\\n*   **Generality:** This model is a generalization of simpler linear models. For `param2 -> 0`, the Taylor expansion of the oscillatory part is `exp(param2 * cos(...)) ≈ 1 + param2 * cos(...)`. This recovers the form of a decaying offset plus a standard oscillation, linking this non-linear model to simpler linear superposition theories in the low-asymmetry limit.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * exp(-gamma * t + param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\\\"Coupled-Mode Decay\\\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\\n\\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\\n\\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\\n\\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \\\"mode coupling\\\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\\n\\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThis \\\"Coupled-Mode Decay\\\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\\n</final_result>\"}",
