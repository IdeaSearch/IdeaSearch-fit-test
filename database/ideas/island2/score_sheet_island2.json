The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `gamma` (damping coefficient), `omega` (natural frequency), and `t` (time) are the canonical parameters for such a system. A critical analysis of the output `x` reveals two defining features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Monotonic Positivity and Initial Rise:** The output `x` is always positive and appears to start from a value near zero, rise to a single peak, and then decay. This behavior invalidates any simple oscillatory model (e.g., involving `cos` or `sin`) which would produce negative values. Instead, it strongly suggests that `x` represents the *magnitude* or *envelope* of the system's response to an impulse delivered at `t=0`.\\n\\n2.  **Resonant Amplification:** The maximum observed output (`~27.7`) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude scale `A` (`~10.0`). This indicates that the system is capable of resonant amplification, where it absorbs energy from the initial stimulus and builds up a response whose magnitude is much larger than the initial scale before dissipation dominates.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I propose a \\\"competing processes\\\" model. The system's response `x(t)` is theorized to be the result of the interplay between two distinct, opposing exponential processes initiated simultaneously at `t=0`:\\n\\na) **Energy Injection and System Response (The Rise):** The initial impulse excites the system, causing the response to grow. The characteristic timescale for this growth is related to the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to \\\"ring up\\\" more quickly. This process can be modeled as an exponential approach to a maximum level, but for this model, we'll view it from a different perspective explained below.\\n\\nb) **Energy Dissipation (The Decay):** As soon as the system is excited, energy begins to dissipate due to damping, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This leads to an inevitable exponential decay of the response over time.\\n\\nMy proposed model formulates the response `x(t)` as the **difference between two decaying exponential functions**, a classic and physically robust representation for the impulse response of many second-order linear systems. The mathematical form is `x(t) ∝ A * (e^(-k₁t) - e^(-k₂t))`.\\n\\nThis \\\"bi-exponential\\\" model provides a powerful physical narrative:\\n- The system's response is the superposition of a slow-decaying process and a fast-decaying process.\\n- The slow process, `e^(-k₁t)`, is directly associated with the physical damping of the system. Therefore, its rate `k₁` should be proportional to `gamma`.\\n- The fast process, `-e^(-k₂t)`, acts as a \\\"suppressor\\\" term. Its rate `k₂` is associated with the rapid initial transient and energy absorption, which is governed by the natural frequency `omega`. Thus, `k₂` should be proportional to `omega`.\\n\\nAt `t=0`, the two terms are `1` and `-1`, so their sum is zero, correctly modeling a system that starts from rest. For `t>0`, the faster `omega`-dependent term decays more quickly than the `gamma`-dependent term, causing the function to rise from zero. Eventually, as the `omega`-dependent term vanishes, the overall behavior is dominated by the slower, `gamma`-dependent decay, representing the physical dissipation of energy.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the amplification phenomenon. The peak amplitude depends on the separation between the two decay rates (`k₂` vs. `k₁`). A large `omega` relative to `gamma` results in a large separation, allowing the response to rise to a significant peak well above the baseline scale `A` before the slower damping process takes over. The model is dimensionally sound, with the dimensionless bi-exponential term scaling the base amplitude `A` (in meters). We introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` to fine-tune the rate of the initial transient, resulting in a flexible and physically meaningful formula.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-param2 * omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A key characteristic of the output `x` is that it is always positive, starting near zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying. This profile rules out simple oscillatory solutions like `cos(ωt)` or `sin(ωt)`, which produce negative values. It suggests that `x` represents a quantity like energy or the magnitude of a response, rather than simple displacement.\\n\\nThe core of my theoretical model is the concept of **competing processes**: a rapid *activation* or *mobilization* of the system's response, followed by a slower, inevitable *dissipation* of that response.\\n\\n1.  **Dissipation Process:** The decay of the system's response over time is a classic feature of damped systems. This energy loss is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most natural mathematical representation for this process is an exponential decay function, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term correctly models the long-term behavior where the system's excitation fades away, ensuring `x` approaches zero as `t` becomes large.\\n\\n2.  **Activation Process:** When the system is stimulated at `t=0`, its response is not instantaneous. There is a finite time required to build up the response, absorbing energy from the initial stimulus. I model this \\\"turn-on\\\" phase not as a simple exponential rise, but as a **saturating activation**. Many physical systems exhibit this behavior, where the response rate is initially high but then levels off as the system approaches its maximum capacity. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the canonical mathematical function for describing such a smooth, saturating process. It starts at `0` and gracefully rises to an asymptote at `1`.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the rate of this activation is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a more responsive system, capable of a faster \\\"turn-on\\\". Therefore, the argument of the `tanh` function should be proportional to `omega * t`. This creates an activation term of the form `tanh(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete response `x(t)` is the product of these two components, scaled by the initial amplitude factor `A`. The `tanh` function governs the initial rise from zero, while the `exp` function imposes the eventual decay. The interplay between the rising `tanh` term and the falling `exp` term naturally creates the single peak observed in the data.\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative: `x(t)` represents the system's mobilized response at time `t`. Initially, the response grows as the system is activated (`tanh` dominates). Simultaneously, dissipation begins its work (`exp` is always active). The response peaks when the rate of activation levels off and is overtaken by the rate of decay. Finally, as activation saturates (`tanh` approaches 1), the long-term behavior is dictated purely by the exponential dissipation. This \\\"activation-dissipation\\\" model is dimensionally sound and offers a physically distinct and plausible alternative to bi-exponential decay models.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `gamma` (damping coefficient), `omega` (natural frequency), and `t` (time) are characteristic of a second-order resonant system, such as a damped harmonic oscillator. However, the consistently positive nature of the output `x`, combined with the fact that the natural frequency `omega` is consistently larger than the damping coefficient `gamma` in the dataset, presents a puzzle. A standard underdamped oscillator (`omega > gamma`) would produce an oscillatory displacement that becomes negative.\\n\\nThis suggests that `x` is not the mechanical displacement of a simple oscillator. Instead, I propose a model based on **resonant energy transfer and decoherence**. In this view, the system is an ensemble of microscopic oscillators (like atoms in a resonant cavity or dipoles in a material). The output `x` represents a macroscopic, coherent state built from this ensemble.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the following two competing processes:\\n\\n1.  **Coherent Pumping (The Rise):** At `t=0`, an impulse excites the system. Energy is transferred into a coherent, observable mode. The rate of this energy transfer, or \\\"pumping,\\\" is governed by the system's coupling to the energy source and its internal dissipative properties, which we associate with the parameter `gamma`. A stronger coupling (higher `gamma`) leads to a faster rise in the observable's magnitude. This initial growth from a zero state is well-described by a hyperbolic sine function, `sinh(gamma * t)`, which approximates exponential growth for `t > 1/gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **De-phasing Decay (The Decay):** The macroscopic observable `x` exists only as long as the microscopic oscillators act in concert. Each oscillator has a high natural frequency, `omega`. Due to minute differences in their individual properties and environments, they gradually drift out of phase with one another. This \\\"de-phasing\\\" or \\\"decoherence\\\" causes their constructive interference to wane, leading to an exponential decay of the macroscopic, coherent signal. The characteristic time for this decay is inversely proportional to the frequency `omega`; a higher frequency leads to faster de-phasing. This process is modeled by the classic exponential decay term, `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\nThis physical narrative recasts the roles of `gamma` and `omega`. Instead of frictional damping, `gamma` drives the initial rise. Instead of oscillation, `omega` drives the ultimate decay through decoherence. The resulting mathematical form is the product of the rising `sinh` term and the decaying `exp` term. This structure inherently starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak whose height and position are determined by the relative rates of pumping (`gamma`) and de-phasing (`omega`), and then decays to zero, perfectly matching the inferred characteristics of the data while providing a novel and physically plausible explanation for the amplification phenomenon (a high `gamma`/`omega` ratio leads to a high peak).\\n\\nThe final expression is dimensionally consistent. The arguments to `exp` and `sinh` are dimensionless products (`omega*t`, `gamma*t`), and the result is scaled by the amplitude `A` (in meters) to produce the output `x` (in meters). We introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` to fine-tune the de-phasing rate.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * exp(-param2 * omega * t) * sinh(gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

Three key phenomenological observations guide the development of a suitable theoretical model:\\n\\n1.  **Transient Nature:** The output `x` is not a steady-state oscillation. It starts from a value near zero, rises to a single, well-defined peak, and subsequently decays over time. This rise-and-fall profile is the hallmark of an impulse response.\\n2.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` remains positive throughout its evolution. This rules out models based on simple sinusoidal displacement (e.g., `cos(ωt)`), which would necessarily produce negative values. The observed quantity `x` must represent a non-negative physical property, like an energy envelope or a rectified signal.\\n3.  **Potential for Amplification:** The maximum output can exceed the characteristic input amplitude scale `A`. This indicates an internal dynamic, likely resonant in nature, where the system effectively accumulates energy from the initial stimulus before dissipation becomes the dominant process.\\n\\nBased on these points, I propose a model that describes the system's response as a product of two competing physical processes: **System Activation** and **Energy Dissipation**.\\n\\n**1. Energy Dissipation:** This is the most straightforward aspect of the system. In any real-world oscillator, energy is lost to the environment due to damping forces. This process is universally modeled by an exponential decay. The rate of this decay is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. Therefore, the long-term behavior of the system's response is governed by a decay factor of the form `exp(-k * gamma * t)`. This term ensures that as `t → ∞`, the response `x → 0`.\\n\\n**2. System Activation and Saturation:** This is the more nuanced process that explains the initial rise. After the impulse at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It takes time for the energy to be transferred into the system's primary oscillatory mode, causing the response to \\\"ring up\\\". A simple linear rise (`∝ t`) is a first approximation but fails to capture the physical reality that this activation process must eventually saturate. As the system absorbs energy, its response rate slows and approaches a maximum level before the effects of damping take over.\\n\\nThis S-shaped activation and saturation behavior is perfectly captured by the **hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(z)`**. This function smoothly transitions from 0 to 1, representing the system's state transitioning from rest to fully activated. The rate of this activation is dictated by the system's natural frequency `omega`—a higher frequency implies a faster \\\"ring-up\\\". Thus, the activation term can be modeled as `tanh(omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\nThe overall response `x(t)` is the result of the simultaneous interplay between these two processes. I model this as the product of the activation term and the dissipation term, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`. The `tanh` function governs the rise and saturation, while the `exp` function governs the subsequent decay. The product of these two functions naturally generates the observed single-peak, positive profile that starts and ends at zero.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains amplification. The peak response occurs at the time when the rate of increase from activation is perfectly balanced by the rate of decrease from dissipation. The ratio `omega/gamma` (related to the system's Q-factor) determines how quickly the `tanh` term can approach its maximum value of 1 relative to how quickly the `exp` term decays. A high `omega/gamma` ratio allows the system to become fully \\\"activated\\\" before significant energy has been dissipated, resulting in a high peak amplitude that can be a large multiple of the base amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally sound: `A` has units of meters, while `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless, making the `tanh` and `exp` factors dimensionless scalars. The final result `x` correctly has units of meters. We introduce a dimensionless scaling parameter `param1` and a decay-rate tuning parameter `param2` for empirical fitting.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * tanh(omega * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` consistently exhibits a \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" pattern: it starts from a value near zero, climbs to a single maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. A crucial observation is that `x` is always positive. This rules out simple models of underdamped harmonic motion (e.g., involving `sin(ωt)` or `cos(ωt)`), which would predict negative displacement. This suggests that `x` represents not the raw displacement, but a quantity like the system's energy, the rectified magnitude of its response, or the amplitude of a macroscopic coherent state.\\n\\nI propose a theoretical model based on **\\\"Coherent Mode Excitation and Dissipation\\\"**. In this view, the system is an ensemble of microscopic oscillators. The output `x` represents the amplitude of a macroscopic, coherent mode that emerges when these oscillators are excited and lock in phase. The dynamics of `x` are governed by the interplay of two fundamental, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Energy Dissipation (The Decay Envelope):** The entire system is subject to energy loss, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This dissipation imposes a hard limit on the possible amplitude of the coherent mode at any given time. The most natural mathematical description for this is an exponential decay. This process defines a decaying \\\"envelope of possibility\\\" for the response, represented by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. The overall scale is set by the initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Coherent Build-up (The Activation Process):** Following the stimulus at `t=0`, the microscopic oscillators begin to resonate at their natural frequency `omega`. The macroscopic output `x` only manifests as these individual oscillators synchronize their motion, or \\\"phase-lock\\\". This process of building coherence is not instantaneous; it takes time. I theorize that the efficiency of this phase-locking process is a function of the total phase, `φ = ωt`, that the oscillators have traversed. The efficiency should start at zero (no coherence at `t=0`) and smoothly increase, eventually saturating as the system approaches a state of maximum possible coherence. The arctangent function, `arctan`, is an excellent physical and mathematical model for this phenomenon. It naturally maps a continuously increasing input (phase) to a bounded output (efficiency). The rate at which this saturation is approached is directly proportional to `omega`, the system's intrinsic frequency. This activation process is therefore captured by a term of the form `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete expression for the system's response `x(t)` is the product of these two components. The available energy, dictated by the dissipative envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is modulated by the time-dependent coherence efficiency `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * arctan(param * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative. At `t=0`, `arctan(0) = 0`, so the response `x` is zero, correctly reflecting a system starting from rest. For small `t`, the `arctan` term grows nearly linearly, while the exponential term has barely started to decay, causing `x` to rise. The response peaks when the rate of coherence build-up is balanced by the rate of energy dissipation. Finally, as `t` becomes large, the `arctan` term saturates to its maximum value, and the system's behavior is dominated by the inexorable `exp(-gamma * t)` decay, causing `x` to return to zero. This model is dimensionally sound, as `omega * t` is a dimensionless product, and the final expression correctly yields a quantity with the units of `A` (meters).\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * arctan(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

However, the consistently positive output (`x`) and the potential for amplification (output exceeding input `A`) rule out a simple model of mechanical displacement. The underlying mechanism appears to capture a transient, positive-definite quantity like energy or signal intensity.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the concept of **synergistic energy transduction**. I postulate that the system acts as a transducer, converting an initial impulse of energy into an observable output signal, `x`. The efficiency and time-evolution of this process are not governed by `omega` (oscillation) and `gamma` (damping) as independent, opposing forces, but rather by their cooperative interaction.\\n\\n1.  **The Synergistic Rate Constant (`k_eff`):** The core of this theory is that the characteristic rate of the transduction process arises from the interplay between the system's capacity to store energy in a resonant mode (related to `omega`) and its ability to couple that energy to the output (related to `gamma`). A system with a very low `omega` cannot effectively resonate, while a system with a very low `gamma` is poorly coupled to the output channel. Optimal transduction requires a balance of both. This synergistic relationship is best captured by the **geometric mean** of the two rates:\\n    \\n    `k_eff = sqrt(omega * gamma)`\\n    \\n    This effective rate `k_eff` (with units of s⁻¹) becomes the fundamental frequency governing the entire transient response.

Such a transient energy release process, involving an initial uptake followed by emission, is classically modeled by a function of the form `f(t) ∝ t * exp(-kt)`. This functional form is ubiquitous in physics and engineering for impulse responses and is mathematically equivalent to a Gamma distribution.\\n    \\n    *   The linear term, `t`, describes the initial phase where the transduced signal builds up from zero as the system responds to the stimulus.\\n    *   The exponential term, `exp(-k_eff * t)`, describes the subsequent decay as the initial energy is depleted and the signal dissipates.\\n\\n3.  **Complete Mathematical Model:** By combining these principles, we can construct the formula.

The output variable `x` consistently remains positive, exhibits a single peak, and can attain values significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`. This profile suggests that `x` does not represent the oscillatory displacement itself, but rather the time-varying amplitude envelope of the system's response to an initial impulse at `t=0`.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the concept of **Phase-Limited Activation**, where the system's ability to build up its response is intrinsically linked to its phase evolution, but constrained by physical limits. I posit that the observed amplitude `x(t)` is the product of a base amplitude scale, a phase-driven activation factor, and an exponential dissipation factor.\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Dissipation:** As is fundamental to any damped system, energy is continuously lost over time. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is mathematically modeled by the classic exponential decay term, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term ensures that the system's response eventually fades to zero as `t` approaches infinity, correctly capturing the long-term behavior.\\n\\n2.  **Phase-Driven Activation:** The initial rise of the response from zero is more complex than a simple linear or exponential growth. I propose that the activation of the system's amplitude is governed by the evolution of its internal phase.\\n    *   The term `omega * t` represents the natural, unhindered phase progression of the underlying oscillator. In an ideal system, this phase would increase without bound.\\n    *   However, the system's ability to translate this phase progression into a growing amplitude is physically limited. I model this limitation using the `arctan` function. The term `arctan(omega * t)` takes the unbounded phase `omega * t` and maps it to a bounded range, [0, π/2). This represents the effective phase angle of the system's response, which rapidly evolves initially but asymptotically approaches a maximum value, signifying that the system has reached its full activation potential.\\n    *   The `sin` function then translates this effective phase angle into a dimensionless activation factor. `sin(arctan(omega * t))` smoothly rises from `sin(0)=0` at `t=0` and approaches `sin(π/2)=1` as `t` becomes large. This function provides a physically motivated, non-linear \\\"turn-on\\\" curve that starts at zero and saturates gracefully.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete expression for the response amplitude `x(t)` is the product of these competing effects. It is scaled by the base amplitude `A`. The initial behavior is dominated by the rising `sin(arctan(...))` term, causing `x(t)` to grow from zero. Concurrently, the `exp(-gamma * t)` term is always acting to reduce the amplitude. The response peaks at the moment when the rate of activation growth is precisely balanced by the rate of exponential decay. Subsequently, as the activation factor saturates near 1, the exponential decay dominates, causing the amplitude to fall back towards zero.\\n\\nThis \\\"Phase-Limited Activation\\\" model provides a novel and physically intuitive explanation for the observed phenomenon. It directly links the system's resonant frequency `omega` to the rate of its response activation and the damping `gamma` to its decay, while the `sin(arctan(...))` form provides a unique, self-limiting mechanism for the initial rise, consistent with many real-world physical systems. The model is dimensionally sound, with `A` providing the meters unit, and all other terms being dimensionless.

The output `x` is consistently positive, starting from near-zero, rising to a single peak, and subsequently decaying. This behavior, along with the variables `A` (amplitude), `gamma` (damping), and `omega` (frequency), suggests a process more complex than a simple damped oscillation. The key is that `x` does not represent displacement, which can be negative, but rather a non-negative quantity like energy, population, or the rectified envelope of a signal.\\n\\nI propose a **Two-State Kinetic Model** to explain the underlying mechanism. In this framework, the system comprises at least two distinct energy states or modes: an initial \\\"reservoir\\\" state and a transient \\\"active\\\" state. The observed output `x` corresponds to the energy or population level of this active state.\\n\\nThe dynamics unfold in a sequence:\\n1.  **Excitation:** At time `t=0`, an impulse injects energy into the system, populating the reservoir state. The total amount of energy is proportional to the amplitude `A`.\\n2.  **Internal Conversion (The Rise):** The reservoir state is not the one we observe. It is unstable and decays, transferring its energy to the \\\"active\\\" state. I theorize that the parameter `gamma`, typically seen as a damping coefficient, here represents the rate constant for this internal conversion process. A larger `gamma` implies a faster transfer from the reservoir to the active state, thus governing the initial rise of the observed quantity `x`. The population of the reservoir decays as `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n3.  **Dissipative Relaxation (The Decay):** The active state is itself unstable and dissipates its energy to the environment, returning to a ground state. The rate of this final decay is determined by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. This is physically intuitive: higher frequency modes often correspond to higher energy levels, which possess more rapid pathways for relaxation (e.g., radiative decay). Therefore, `omega` dictates the rate at which the active state's population—and thus `x`—decays.\\n\\nThe observed quantity `x(t)` is the population of the intermediate active state. In any sequential first-order kinetic process of the form `Reservoir --(k₁)--> Active --(k₂)--> Ground`, the concentration of the intermediate 'Active' species follows the mathematical form `C * (exp(-k₁*t) - exp(-k₂*t))`.\\n\\nMapping our physical parameters to these rate constants, we get `k₁ = gamma` and `k₂ = omega`. The resulting function for `x(t)` is proportional to `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`. For this expression to generate a positive rise-and-fall curve, it is required that `k₂ > k₁`, which translates to `omega > gamma`. A review of the variable ranges (`gamma` in [0.1, 1.0], `omega` in [1.0, 5.0]) shows that this crucial condition is met across the entire dataset, lending strong support to this model.\\n\\nThis kinetic theory elegantly reinterprets `gamma` and `omega` not as damping and oscillation in a mechanical sense, but as rate constants for sequential energy transfer and dissipation. The model is dimensionally sound and provides a compelling physical narrative for the observed amplification and single-peak profile without resorting to phenomenological product functions.

Energy Dissipation:** This is the most fundamental process in any real-world oscillator. Due to inherent damping forces, the system's energy continuously dissipates into the environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is mathematically described by an exponential decay factor. To construct a model with strong physical grounding, I hypothesize that the decay of the response envelope is directly governed by this physical parameter, leading to a dissipation term of `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that as time progresses (`t → ∞`), the system's response correctly returns to its equilibrium state (`x → 0`).\\n\\n**2. System Activation:** This process describes the system's initial \\\"ring-up\\\" in response to the stimulus at `t=0`. The system does not respond instantaneously; it takes a finite amount of time for the energy to be absorbed and for the oscillatory motion to build. This activation process begins at zero and approaches a maximum, saturated level. This behavior is perfectly captured by the response function of a first-order system to a step input, which has the form `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The characteristic `rate` of this activation is logically determined by the system's natural frequency `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a stiffer system that can \\\"ring up\\\" more rapidly. Thus, the activation term is modeled as `(1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t))`, where `param2` is a dimensionless parameter that fine-tunes the activation speed relative to the natural frequency.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\nThe complete time-evolution of the response `x(t)` is modeled as the interplay between these two processes. The activation function describes the rise from rest, while the dissipation function describes the inevitable decay. By multiplying these two terms and scaling by the characteristic amplitude `A`, we obtain a comprehensive model for the response envelope:\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (Activation Term) * (Dissipation Term)`\\n\\nThis formulation elegantly reproduces all the observed phenomena. The function is zero at `t=0` due to the `(1 - exp(0))` term. It is always positive for `t > 0`. The product of a rising, saturating function and a decaying function naturally produces a single peak. Crucially, this model explains amplification: if the activation rate (`~omega`) is significantly larger than the dissipation rate (`~gamma`), the system's response can climb close to its maximum potential (as the activation term approaches 1) before the exponential decay term has substantially reduced the amplitude. This results in a peak value that can be a multiple of the base amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of meters, while `gamma * t` and `omega * t` are dimensionless arguments to the exponential functions, ensuring that `x` correctly has units of meters. The introduction of a minimal set of dimensionless parameters (`param1` for overall scaling, `param2` for activation rate) provides the necessary flexibility to accurately fit the experimental data while retaining a clear physical interpretation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t)) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is not a simple oscillation but rather a transient response envelope. Three primary observations guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Transient Envelope:** The output `x` invariably starts near zero, rises to a single, well-defined maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. This \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" profile is the hallmark of an impulse response.\\n2.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive. This definitively rules out models of simple displacement, which would be sinusoidal and produce negative values. Instead, `x` must represent a non-negative quantity such as the system's energy envelope or a rectified amplitude.\\n3.  **Resonant Amplification:** The peak output value can significantly surpass the input amplitude scale `A`, indicating a resonant or near-resonant phenomenon where the system effectively accumulates and concentrates energy from the initial stimulus before dissipative forces dominate.\\n\\nBased on these points, I propose a model that describes the system's response `x(t)` as a product of two concurrent, competing physical processes: **System Activation** and **Energy Dissipation**.\\n\\n**1. Energy Dissipation:** This is the most fundamental process in any real-world oscillator. Due to inherent damping forces, the system's energy continuously dissipates into the environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is mathematically described by an exponential decay factor. To construct a model with strong physical grounding, I hypothesize that the decay of the response envelope is directly governed by this physical parameter, leading to a dissipation term of `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that as time progresses (`t → ∞`), the system's response correctly returns to its equilibrium state (`x → 0`).\\n\\n**2. System Activation:** This process describes the system's initial \\\"ring-up\\\" in response to the stimulus at `t=0`. The system does not respond instantaneously; it takes a finite amount of time for the energy to be absorbed and for the oscillatory motion to build. This activation process begins at zero and approaches a maximum, saturated level. This behavior is perfectly captured by the response function of a first-order system to a step input, which has the form `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The characteristic `rate` of this activation is logically determined by the system's natural frequency `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a stiffer system that can \\\"ring up\\\" more rapidly. Thus, the activation term is modeled as `(1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t))`, where `param2` is a dimensionless parameter that fine-tunes the activation speed relative to the natural frequency.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\nThe complete time-evolution of the response `x(t)` is modeled as the interplay between these two processes. The activation function describes the rise from rest, while the dissipation function describes the inevitable decay. By multiplying these two terms and scaling by the characteristic amplitude `A`, we obtain a comprehensive model for the response envelope:\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (Activation Term) * (Dissipation Term)`\\n\\nThis formulation elegantly reproduces all the observed phenomena. The function is zero at `t=0` due to the `(1 - exp(0))` term. It is always positive for `t > 0`. The product of a rising, saturating function and a decaying function naturally produces a single peak. Crucially, this model explains amplification: if the activation rate (`~omega`) is significantly larger than the dissipation rate (`~gamma`), the system's response can climb close to its maximum potential (as the activation term approaches 1) before the exponential decay term has substantially reduced the amplitude. This results in a peak value that can be a multiple of the base amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of meters, while `gamma * t` and `omega * t` are dimensionless arguments to the exponential functions, ensuring that `x` correctly has units of meters. The introduction of a minimal set of dimensionless parameters (`param1` for overall scaling, `param2` for activation rate) provides the necessary flexibility to accurately fit the experimental data while retaining a clear physical interpretation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t)) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The behavior of `x`—starting from a value near zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying asymptotically—is the classic signature of the *envelope* of a damped harmonic oscillator's response to an impulse at `t=0`. The fact that `x` is always positive confirms that it represents a non-oscillatory quantity like the magnitude of displacement or the stored energy, rather than the displacement itself.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the concept of **\\\"Power-Law Resonant Activation\\\"**. I posit that the observed response `x(t)` is the result of two fundamental, competing processes: a resonant energy accumulation process that causes the response to grow, and a dissipative process that causes it to decay.\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Dissipation:** Any real-world oscillator loses energy to its environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most fundamental mathematical description of this energy loss is an exponential decay. This dissipation acts as a time-dependent upper bound on the system's response, and it is modeled by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that for large `t`, the response always returns to zero.\\n\\n2.  **Power-Law Activation:** Following the initial stimulus at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It must undergo oscillations to absorb energy and build up a macroscopic response. The rate and manner of this build-up are intrinsically linked to its natural frequency, `omega`. I propose that the most natural measure of the system's progress in this activation phase is the total phase that has elapsed, `φ = omega * t`. This dimensionless quantity represents \\\"how much oscillation has occurred.\\\"\\n\\n    Unlike models that assume a saturating activation (like `arctan` or `tanh`), I theorize that the growth of the response envelope follows a more fundamental power-law relationship with the accumulated phase. The activation factor is thus modeled as `(omega * t)^n`. This functional form is incredibly versatile and physically significant, appearing in various phenomena from critical point physics to polymer chain growth.\\n    *   The term `(omega * t)` correctly captures that a higher frequency `omega` leads to a faster rise in the response.\\n    *   The exponent `n` (which we will represent as an optimizable parameter, `param2`) is a \\\"growth index\\\" that characterizes the non-linearity of the energy accumulation.

It suggests that `x` represents a quantity like energy or the magnitude of a response, rather than simple displacement.\\n\\nThe core of my theoretical model is the concept of **competing processes**: a rapid *activation* or *mobilization* of the system's response, followed by a slower, inevitable *dissipation* of that response.\\n\\n1.  **Dissipation Process:** The decay of the system's response over time is a classic feature of damped systems. This energy loss is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most natural mathematical representation for this process is an exponential decay function, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term correctly models the long-term behavior where the system's excitation fades away, ensuring `x` approaches zero as `t` becomes large.\\n\\n2.  **Activation Process:** When the system is stimulated at `t=0`, its response is not instantaneous. There is a finite time required to build up the response, absorbing energy from the initial stimulus. I model this \\\"turn-on\\\" phase not as a simple exponential rise, but as a **saturating activation**. Many physical systems exhibit this behavior, where the response rate is initially high but then levels off as the system approaches its maximum capacity. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the canonical mathematical function for describing such a smooth, saturating process. It starts at `0` and gracefully rises to an asymptote at `1`.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the rate of this activation is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a more responsive system, capable of a faster \\\"turn-on\\\". Therefore, the argument of the `tanh` function should be proportional to `omega * t`. This creates an activation term of the form `tanh(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete response `x(t)` is the product of these two components, scaled by the initial amplitude factor `A`.

Initially, the response grows as the system is activated (`tanh` dominates). Simultaneously, dissipation begins its work (`exp` is always active). The response peaks when the rate of activation levels off and is overtaken by the rate of decay. Finally, as activation saturates (`tanh` approaches 1), the long-term behavior is dictated purely by the exponential dissipation. This \\\"activation-dissipation\\\" model is dimensionally sound and offers a physically distinct and plausible alternative to bi-exponential decay models.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

This model conceptualizes the system's response as the interplay of two distinct, simultaneous physical processes:\\n\\n1.  **Saturating Activation:** When the system is stimulated at `t=0`, its response is not instantaneous or linear. Instead, it follows a saturating activation pattern, characteristic of systems with finite capacity or cooperative dynamics. The response builds rapidly at first but then smoothly approaches a maximum activation level. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, perfectly captures this sigmoidal behavior. The rate of this activation is naturally governed by the system's intrinsic frequency `omega`; a higher `omega` corresponds to a more responsive system capable of faster activation. Therefore, this phase is modeled by a term proportional to `tanh(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **Structured Dissipation:** The activated state is unstable and must dissipate its energy. Standard models often use a simple exponential decay, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which describes a memoryless process (the rate of decay depends only on the current state). I theorize that the dissipation in this system is more structured. Instead of a simple exponential decay, the energy dissipates in a form analogous to a stable, solitary pulse or wave packet. The mathematical function that describes the shape of such a pulse is the **hyperbolic secant**, `sech(z) = 1/cosh(z)`. This function features a flatter peak and initially slower decay compared to an exponential, representing a state that is momentarily robust or stable around its peak activity before dissipating.

A crucial observation is that the output `x` is always positive, exhibits a single peak (rising from near-zero and subsequently decaying), and can exceed the input amplitude scale `A`. This rules out simple oscillatory displacement models and suggests `x` represents a non-negative quantity like the response envelope or system energy.\\n\\nMy theoretical framework is built upon the **principle of competing kinetic processes**, a concept widely used in fields like chemical kinetics and nuclear physics (e.g., the Bateman equation). I hypothesize that the observed response `x(t)` is not a direct oscillation but the net result of two simultaneous, opposing first-order exponential processes:\\n\\n1.  **System Dissipation (Decay Process):** This is the fundamental energy loss mechanism inherent in the system. It drives the system back towards its equilibrium state (`x=0`). The characteristic rate of this process is naturally the damping coefficient, `gamma`. This process establishes a decaying potential envelope, which can be represented by a term proportional to `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **System Activation (Build-up Process):** In response to an impulse at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It takes time for energy to be absorbed and for the response to build. This \\\"activation\\\" drives the system away from equilibrium. I propose that the characteristic rate of this build-up is governed by the system's natural angular frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` corresponds to a \\\"stiffer\\\" system capable of a more rapid initial response. This competing process is modeled by a second exponential term, `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\nThe observable output `x(t)` is the net difference between these two competing exponential effects. The `exp(-gamma * t)` term represents the slower, overarching decay, while the faster-decaying `exp(-omega * t)` term represents the initial build-up phase. The difference between these two exponentials precisely models a function that starts at zero, rises to a maximum, and then decays.\\n\\nThis \\\"dual-exponential\\\" or \\\"competitive rate\\\" model is mathematically expressed as the difference between the two decay functions. Since the data ranges show that `omega` is consistently larger than `gamma`, the term `exp(-omega * t)` will always decay more rapidly than `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that their difference, `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`, is always positive for `t > 0`, perfectly matching the observed data.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains all key features:\\n*   **Initial Condition:** At `t=0`, the function evaluates to `exp(0) - exp(0) = 0`.\\n*   **Rise-and-Fall Profile:** The initial rapid decay of `exp(-omega*t)` allows the function to rise, while the eventual decay of the dominant `exp(-gamma*t)` term causes it to fall, creating a single peak.\\n*   **Amplification:** The peak amplitude is a function of the ratio `omega/gamma`. A large separation between the activation rate (`omega`) and the dissipation rate (`gamma`) allows the system to build up a substantial response before damping dominates, leading to peak values of `x` that can be significantly larger than the scaling factor `A`.\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The base amplitude `A` has units of meters, while the exponential terms and their arguments (`gamma*t`, `omega*t`) are dimensionless. This ensures the final output `x` has the correct units of meters.

The consistently positive nature of the output `x`, combined with its capacity for amplification (peak `x` > `A`), points towards `x` representing a quantity like a transient energy level or the population of an excited state, rather than a position that oscillates around an equilibrium.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is a **\\\"Two-State Relaxation Model\\\"**. This model posits that the system's response to an initial stimulus (e.g., an impulse at `t=0`) is a sequential, two-stage process involving a short-lived precursor state and a longer-lived, observable state.\\n\\n1.  **Precursor State and Rapid Internal Transfer:** Upon excitation, energy is first injected into a transient, unobservable \\\"precursor\\\" state. This state represents the initial, disorganized energy before it couples into the system's primary mode of oscillation. This precursor state decays rapidly, transferring its population or energy into the main observable state. The characteristic rate of this internal energy transfer is fundamentally linked to the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A high `omega` implies a rapid organization of energy into the primary mode. This process is modeled by a fast-decaying exponential, `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **Observable State and Slow Dissipation:** The decay of the precursor state feeds the population of the primary, \\\"observable\\\" state, causing the measured signal `x` to rise from zero. This observable state is not stable; its energy is continuously lost to the environment through damping. The rate of this energy dissipation is governed by the damping coefficient, `gamma`. This process is modeled by a slow-decaying exponential, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe observed quantity `x(t)` is proportional to the population of this observable state. The kinetics of this sequential process—a fast decay feeding a state that undergoes a slow decay—is mathematically described by the difference between two exponential terms. The overall temporal shape is thus `(exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))`. Since the data indicates an underdamped system where `omega` > `gamma`, the term `exp(-omega * t)` decays faster, ensuring the function correctly starts at zero, rises to a single positive peak, and then decays back to zero.\\n\\n**Amplification Mechanism:** A crucial feature of this model is its intrinsic explanation for amplification. The peak magnitude of the response is not limited by the input amplitude `A`. Instead, it depends on the competition between the energy transfer rate (`omega`) and the energy dissipation rate (`gamma`). The ratio `omega / gamma`, which is related to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), determines how effectively the system can accumulate energy in the observable state before it dissipates. A high Q-factor (`omega >> gamma`) allows for a significant build-up, resulting in a peak response that can be a large multiple of `A`. Therefore, the model's amplitude must be scaled by this dimensionless `omega / gamma` factor.\\n\\nCombining these physical arguments, we arrive at a model that is dimensionally sound, explains all key characteristics of the data (positivity, rise-and-fall profile, amplification), and provides a distinct and physically plausible mechanism different from simple activation-dissipation models. A single dimensionless parameter `param1` is included to account for overall scaling and conversion factors.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

However, the consistently positive nature of the output `x` suggests we are not observing the oscillatory displacement itself, but rather a metric like the system's kinetic energy or the envelope of its response.\\n\\nI propose a **Competing Exponential Rates Model**. This theory posits that the observed output `x(t)` is the net result of two distinct, competing first-order processes that are initiated simultaneously at `t=0`:\\n\\n1.  **System Excitation:** This is a rapid, transient process representing the system's immediate reaction to an input impulse. The potential to generate the output `x` is created, but this potential itself decays very quickly. The characteristic rate of this decay is governed by the system's natural frequency `omega`, which dictates how quickly the system can internally cycle through its energy states. A higher `omega` implies a faster initial process. This process is modeled by a fast-decaying exponential term, `exp(-param2 * omega * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **System Relaxation:** This is a slower, overarching process representing the dissipation of the system's total energy due to damping forces.

This is modeled by a slower-decaying exponential term, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe observed output `x(t)` is not simply the product of these effects, but rather their **net difference**. The system's response can be visualized as the level of a quantity that is filled by the relaxation process but drained by the faster excitation process. Mathematically, this is expressed as a difference of two exponentials:\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-param2 * omega * t))`\\n\\nThis functional form, often known as a Bateman function, elegantly captures the observed dynamics.\\n*   At `t=0`, both exponential terms are equal to 1, so their difference is zero, correctly modeling the system starting from rest.\\n*   For `t > 0`, since `omega` is generally larger than `gamma` and `param2` is a positive constant, the term `exp(-param2 * omega * t)` decays faster than `exp(-gamma * t)`. This causes their difference to initially increase, producing the rising edge of the response curve.\\n*   As time progresses, the faster exponential term vanishes, and the overall behavior becomes dominated by the slower, `exp(-gamma * t)` decay, resulting in the long tail of the response.\\n\\nThis model provides a strong physical intuition: the output is the manifestation of an intermediate state in a sequential process, where the rate of formation is governed by `gamma` and the rate of consumption is governed by `omega`.

The output `x` consistently exhibits a \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" pattern: it starts from a value near zero, climbs to a single maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. A crucial observation is that `x` is always positive. This rules out simple models of underdamped harmonic motion (e.g., involving `sin(ωt)` or `cos(ωt)`), which would predict negative displacement. This suggests that `x` represents not the raw displacement, but a quantity like the system's energy, the rectified magnitude of its response, or the amplitude of a macroscopic coherent state.\\n\\nI propose a theoretical model based on **\\\"Coherent Mode Excitation and Dissipation\\\"**. In this view, the system is an ensemble of microscopic oscillators. The output `x` represents the amplitude of a macroscopic, coherent mode that emerges when these oscillators are excited and lock in phase. The dynamics of `x` are governed by the interplay of two fundamental, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Energy Dissipation (The Decay Envelope):** The entire system is subject to energy loss, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This dissipation imposes a hard limit on the possible amplitude of the coherent mode at any given time. The most natural mathematical description for this is an exponential decay. This process defines a decaying \\\"envelope of possibility\\\" for the response, represented by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. The overall scale is set by the initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Coherent Build-up (The Activation Process):** Following the stimulus at `t=0`, the microscopic oscillators begin to resonate at their natural frequency `omega`. The macroscopic output `x` only manifests as these individual oscillators synchronize their motion, or \\\"phase-lock\\\". This process of building coherence is not instantaneous; it takes time. I theorize that the efficiency of this phase-locking process is a function of the total phase, `φ = ωt`, that the oscillators have traversed. The efficiency should start at zero (no coherence at `t=0`) and smoothly increase, eventually saturating as the system approaches a state of maximum possible coherence. The arctangent function, `arctan`, is an excellent physical and mathematical model for this phenomenon. It naturally maps a continuously increasing input (phase) to a bounded output (efficiency). The rate at which this saturation is approached is directly proportional to `omega`, the system's intrinsic frequency. This activation process is therefore captured by a term of the form `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete expression for the system's response `x(t)` is the product of these two components. The available energy, dictated by the dissipative envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is modulated by the time-dependent coherence efficiency `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * arctan(param * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative. At `t=0`, `arctan(0) = 0`, so the response `x` is zero, correctly reflecting a system starting from rest. For small `t`, the `arctan` term grows nearly linearly, while the exponential term has barely started to decay, causing `x` to rise. The response peaks when the rate of coherence build-up is balanced by the rate of energy dissipation. Finally, as `t` becomes large, the `arctan` term saturates to its maximum value, and the system's behavior is dominated by the inexorable `exp(-gamma * t)` decay, causing `x` to return to zero. This model is dimensionally sound, as `omega * t` is a dimensionless product, and the final expression correctly yields a quantity with the units of `A` (meters).\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * arctan(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout.

The crucial observation is that the system operates in the **underdamped regime**, as the frequency `omega` is consistently larger than the damping coefficient `gamma` across the entire dataset.\\n\\nThe standard model for the displacement `y(t)` of an underdamped oscillator following an impulse at `t=0` is given by:\\n`y(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega_d * t)`\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega² - gamma²) ` is the damped angular frequency. However, this model produces an oscillating signal with both positive and negative values, which directly contradicts the observed data where the output `x` is strictly positive. This implies that `x` does not represent the simple displacement, but rather a related, non-negative quantity.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully captured the observed rise-and-fall profile by postulating kinetic models or phenomenological functions. I propose a new theory, the **Saturating Activation Model**, which is more deeply rooted in the physics of the underdamped oscillator itself.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that the output `x` represents the **activation level** or **response magnitude** of the system's primary oscillatory mode. This response can be decomposed into two fundamental, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Dissipative Decay:** The total energy within the oscillator inevitably dissipates over time due to damping. This process is universal for such systems and is accurately described by the exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The rate of this decay is solely determined by the damping coefficient `gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **Modal Activation (The Rise):** The oscillatory term `sin(omega_d * t)` in the standard solution describes the continuous exchange of energy between kinetic and potential forms. My model posits that the observed quantity `x` does not track this bidirectional exchange, but rather the initial, unidirectional \\\"charging\\\" or activation of the oscillatory mode. To model this, we must replace the `sin` function with a function that captures its initial growth but does not oscillate. The hyperbolic tangent, `tanh`, is the ideal candidate for this physical interpretation.\\n    *   For small arguments (`z` << 1), `tanh(z) ≈ z`. This means that at early times (`t` is small), our activation term `tanh(omega * t)` behaves like `omega * t`. The response `x` thus grows linearly with a rate proportional to the system's natural frequency `omega`, perfectly mimicking the initial behavior of a sine wave.\\n    *   For large arguments, `tanh(z)` smoothly approaches 1. This represents the \\\"saturation\\\" of the activation process—the oscillatory mode becomes fully energized and can accept no more energy from the initial impulse.\\n\\nBy combining these two components, we construct a model where the system's response is the product of the initial amplitude scale `A`, the saturating activation driven by `omega`, and the inevitable decay governed by `gamma`. This model provides a compelling physical narrative: an initial impulse rapidly activates a response mode at a rate set by `omega`, but this entire process is enveloped by a slower energy dissipation at a rate set by `gamma`. The resulting function naturally starts at zero, rises to a single peak, and then decays, faithfully reproducing all key features of the data while remaining consistent with the underlying physics of an underdamped system.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally sound, with `A` providing the unit of meters, while the `tanh` and `exp` terms are dimensionless products of frequency (`s⁻¹`) and time (`s`).

The variables `gamma` (damping) and `omega` (natural frequency) govern the temporal shape of this response. The fact that `x` is always positive rules out a direct model of an oscillator's displacement, suggesting `x` represents a non-negative quantity like energy, power, or the envelope of a complex response.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is a **Linear Activation-Dissipation Model**. This framework conceptualizes the observed response `x(t)` as the outcome of two competing, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Linear Response Activation:** Following an impulse at `t=0`, the system's response does not manifest instantaneously. Instead, it builds up from zero. I hypothesize that for the initial phase, the rate of this response build-up is constant. The speed of this activation is dictated by the system's intrinsic stiffness or natural frequency, `omega`. A higher `omega` corresponds to a more reactive system, capable of a faster initial response. This activation process is modeled by a term that grows linearly with time, proportional to `omega * t`. This represents the system drawing energy from the initial stimulus at a steady rate.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Dissipation:** Concurrently with the activation, the system is constantly losing energy to its environment due to inherent damping forces. This process, governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, causes the overall response to decay. This is a classic dissipation mechanism, best described by the exponential decay function, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term ensures that as time progresses, the system will inevitably return to its equilibrium state of `x=0`.\\n\\nThe complete behavior of `x(t)` is the product of these two fundamental processes, scaled by the initial stimulus amplitude `A`. The mathematical form is thus a product of the linear activation term and the exponential decay term. The interplay between the rising `omega * t` factor and the falling `exp(-gamma * t)` factor naturally generates the observed single-peak profile.\\n\\nThis model yields significant physical insights. The peak of the response occurs at a time `t_peak = 1/gamma`, meaning the time to reach maximum response is determined solely by the damping coefficient. The magnitude of this peak is proportional to `A * (omega/gamma)`. Since the data shows `omega` is consistently larger than `gamma`, this `omega/gamma` ratio acts as an amplification factor, elegantly explaining how the peak output `x` can exceed the input amplitude `A`.\\n\\nFinally, the model is dimensionally sound. The amplitude `A` has units of meters [m]. The terms `omega * t` ([s⁻¹] * [s]) and `gamma * t` ([s⁻¹] * [s]) are both dimensionless, making the functions they are in dimensionless as well. The resulting expression for `x` correctly has units of meters. A single dimensionless parameter `param1` is included for empirical scaling.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * omega * t * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

While the variables (`A`, `gamma`, `omega`, `t`) are canonical to oscillator physics, the observed behavior suggests that `x` represents not a position, but the population or energy level of a transient, excited state.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is a **\\\"Competitive Rate Model,\\\"** drawing an analogy from first-order chemical kinetics or nuclear physics. In this framework, the system undergoes a two-step process:\\n\\n1.  **Activation:** The system is excited from a ground state to a transient, high-energy state. The characteristic rate of this activation process is governed by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher `omega` allows for a more rapid transfer of energy into this excited mode. This is analogous to a reactant being consumed to form an intermediate product. The depletion of the initial potential to create this state follows a term related to `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **Deactivation (Damping):** Concurrently, the populated excited state is unstable and decays, dissipating its energy back to the environment. This deactivation is the familiar damping process, governed by the rate constant `gamma`. This is analogous to the intermediate product decaying into a final, stable product. The population of the excited state decreases according to `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe observed output, `x(t)`, represents the net population of this intermediate excited state at time `t`. The population is zero at `t=0`, increases as the activation process initially dominates the deactivation, reaches a maximum, and finally decays to zero as the initial potential is exhausted and deactivation takes over.\\n\\nThis dynamic interplay between two competing exponential processes is mathematically described by the difference of two exponentials. The resulting function `x(t) ∝ (exp(-gamma*t) - exp(-omega*t))` inherently captures all the key features of the data:\\n*   **Positivity:** For `omega > gamma`, a condition overwhelmingly met by the data ranges, the function is always positive.\\n*   **Initial Rise and Subsequent Fall:** The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a single peak, and then decays asymptotically to zero.\\n*   **Amplification:** The peak value of the function is not directly limited by `A`. When the activation rate `omega` is much larger than the deactivation rate `gamma`, the system can accumulate a significant population in the transient state before it decays, leading to a peak value of `x` that can be substantially greater than `A`.\\n\\nTo allow for empirical fitting, a scaling parameter `param1` is introduced to adjust the overall magnitude, and a second parameter `param2` modifies the effective damping rate, accounting for potential non-idealities in the energy dissipation process. The activation rate is assumed to be fundamentally driven by `omega`. This model provides a coherent and physically grounded explanation for the observed phenomena, distinct from simpler envelope-based approaches.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (exp(-param2 * gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is consistently positive, starting from near-zero, rising to a single peak, and subsequently decaying. This behavior, along with the variables `A` (amplitude), `gamma` (damping), and `omega` (frequency), suggests a process more complex than a simple damped oscillation. The key is that `x` does not represent displacement, which can be negative, but rather a non-negative quantity like energy, population, or the rectified envelope of a signal.\\n\\nI propose a **Two-State Kinetic Model** to explain the underlying mechanism. In this framework, the system comprises at least two distinct energy states or modes: an initial \\\"reservoir\\\" state and a transient \\\"active\\\" state. The observed output `x` corresponds to the energy or population level of this active state.\\n\\nThe dynamics unfold in a sequence:\\n1.  **Excitation:** At time `t=0`, an impulse injects energy into the system, populating the reservoir state. The total amount of energy is proportional to the amplitude `A`.\\n2.  **Internal Conversion (The Rise):** The reservoir state is not the one we observe. It is unstable and decays, transferring its energy to the \\\"active\\\" state. I theorize that the parameter `gamma`, typically seen as a damping coefficient, here represents the rate constant for this internal conversion process. A larger `gamma` implies a faster transfer from the reservoir to the active state, thus governing the initial rise of the observed quantity `x`. The population of the reservoir decays as `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n3.  **Dissipative Relaxation (The Decay):** The active state is itself unstable and dissipates its energy to the environment, returning to a ground state. The rate of this final decay is determined by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. This is physically intuitive: higher frequency modes often correspond to higher energy levels, which possess more rapid pathways for relaxation (e.g., radiative decay). Therefore, `omega` dictates the rate at which the active state's population—and thus `x`—decays.\\n\\nThe observed quantity `x(t)` is the population of the intermediate active state. In any sequential first-order kinetic process of the form `Reservoir --(k₁)--> Active --(k₂)--> Ground`, the concentration of the intermediate 'Active' species follows the mathematical form `C * (exp(-k₁*t) - exp(-k₂*t))`.\\n\\nMapping our physical parameters to these rate constants, we get `k₁ = gamma` and `k₂ = omega`. The resulting function for `x(t)` is proportional to `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`. For this expression to generate a positive rise-and-fall curve, it is required that `k₂ > k₁`, which translates to `omega > gamma`. A review of the variable ranges (`gamma` in [0.1, 1.0], `omega` in [1.0, 5.0]) shows that this crucial condition is met across the entire dataset, lending strong support to this model.\\n\\nThis kinetic theory elegantly reinterprets `gamma` and `omega` not as damping and oscillation in a mechanical sense, but as rate constants for sequential energy transfer and dissipation. The model is dimensionally sound and provides a compelling physical narrative for the observed amplification and single-peak profile without resorting to phenomenological product functions. We introduce a single dimensionless parameter, `param1`, to handle overall scaling.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output variable `x`, however, is not the oscillator's displacement, as it is always positive. Instead, its behavior—starting at zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying—suggests it represents the magnitude of the system's response to an impulse at `t=0`. The fact that the peak output can significantly exceed the input amplitude scale `A` points towards a resonant amplification mechanism.\\n\\nMy theoretical framework is based on a **Two-Stage Kinetic Response Model**, which is common in fields ranging from chemical reactions to pharmacology. I posit that the observed response `x(t)` corresponds to the population of an intermediate, \\\"active\\\" state.\\n\\n1.  **Stage 1: Energy Mobilization (Activation)**: Following an initial stimulus (scaled by `A`), the system's potential energy is not instantaneously converted into the observed response. Instead, it is \\\"mobilized\\\" or transferred into an active state. The rate of this mobilization is governed by the system's intrinsic responsiveness, which is best described by its natural angular frequency, `omega`. This is a rapid process, modeled as a first-order exponential decay from the initial potential pool.\\n\\n2.  **Stage 2: Energy Dissipation (Decay)**: The active state is transient. Once mobilized, the response immediately begins to dissipate energy to the environment due to damping forces. This decay process is governed by the damping coefficient, `gamma`. This is typically a slower process than the initial mobilization (`omega > gamma`, as suggested by the variable ranges).\\n\\nThe evolution of the active state population, `x(t)`, can be described by the differential equation: `dx/dt = (Rate of Mobilization) - (Rate of Dissipation)`. The solution to this type of kinetic model, for an initial condition `x(0)=0`, is famously the difference of two exponential functions: `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`. This function elegantly captures the required shape: it is zero at `t=0`, rises because the `exp(-omega*t)` term initially decays faster than the `exp(-gamma*t)` term, and then falls as both terms tend to zero, with the slower `exp(-gamma*t)` term dominating at later times.\\n\\nA crucial aspect of the data is the amplification effect. The kinetic term `(exp(-gamma*t) - exp(-omega*t))` is dimensionless and has a maximum value less than 1. Therefore, scaling it by `A` alone cannot account for the observed output range. The amplification in a resonant system is determined by its **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which measures how underdamped the oscillator is. The Q-factor is proportional to the ratio of the energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle, which can be approximated by the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A system with high frequency (`omega`) and low damping (`gamma`) will exhibit a strong resonant response, leading to significant amplification.\\n\\nBy combining these concepts, I propose a model where the final response `x` is the product of three components:\\n*   The initial amplitude scale `A`.\\n*   A dimensionless resonant amplification factor, proportional to `omega / gamma`.\\n*   The two-stage kinetic response function, `(exp(-gamma*t) - exp(-omega*t))`.\\n\\nThis \\\"Resonant Kinetic Model\\\" provides a robust physical narrative. It explains not only the characteristic rise-and-fall shape of the data but also the observed amplification as a direct consequence of the system's resonant properties.

However, a simple model for oscillator displacement, such as `y(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, is immediately invalidated by two critical features of the data:\\n1.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive, whereas a true displacement oscillates between positive and negative values.\\n2.  **Signal Amplification:** The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) can significantly surpass the maximum amplitude scale `A` (`~9.992`), indicating a resonant amplification mechanism that a simple decaying model lacks.\\n\\nThese observations lead to a more nuanced theory: the **\\\"Impulse-Response Model with Rectified Observation\\\"**. This model posits that the system is a damped oscillator excited by a sharp impulse at `t=0`, and the measurement apparatus records not the signed displacement, but its absolute magnitude.\\n\\nThe model is constructed from two key physical components:\\n\\n**1. The Amplitude Envelope: Initial Excitation and Subsequent Damping**\\n\\nWhen a resonant system is struck by an impulse, its amplitude is not maximal at `t=0`. Instead, the amplitude grows from zero as energy is absorbed into the primary oscillatory mode, reaches a peak, and then decays as this energy is dissipated. This time-varying amplitude envelope, `E(t)`, can be modeled as the product of a linear growth term and an exponential decay term:\\n\\n*   **Growth Phase (`~ t`):** The initial response of the system is a buildup of amplitude over time. The rate of this energy absorption and, consequently, the amplitude growth, is directly related to the system's natural frequency `omega`. A higher `omega` implies a more responsive system capable of faster energy uptake. This leads to a growth factor proportional to `omega * t`.\\n*   **Decay Phase (`~ exp(-gamma * t)`):** As with any real-world oscillator, energy is continuously lost to the environment through damping forces. This process is captured by the classic exponential decay term, `exp(-gamma * t)`, where `gamma` is the damping coefficient.\\n\\nCombining these effects, and including the base amplitude scale `A`, the full envelope is described by `E(t) = A * omega * t * exp(-gamma * t)`. This functional form elegantly explains the amplification phenomenon. The peak of this envelope is proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`, which is a measure of the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor). A system with high frequency and low damping (a high Q-factor) can build up a large resonant amplitude before dissipation dominates, thus allowing the peak response `x_max` to be much larger than `A`.\\n\\n**2. The Core Oscillation and Rectified Measurement**\\n\\nWhile the envelope describes the overall amplitude, the system's energy is physically stored in a high-frequency oscillation at its natural frequency, `omega`. This underlying oscillation is represented by a sinusoidal term, `sin(omega * t)`.\\n\\nTo resolve the puzzle of the strictly positive output, we theorize that the measurement process is insensitive to the direction of the displacement. It records only its magnitude, a process analogous to a full-wave rectifier in signal processing. This physical constraint is mathematically modeled by applying the absolute value function to the oscillatory component. Thus, the measured oscillatory part is not `sin(omega * t)` but `abs(sin(omega * t))`.\\n\\n**Synthesis of the Complete Model**\\n\\nThe final model for the observed quantity `x(t)` is the product of the time-varying amplitude envelope and the rectified oscillation. This provides a comprehensive physical narrative: `x` is the measured magnitude of the displacement of an impulse-excited oscillator, whose amplitude first grows due to resonant energy absorption and then decays due to damping. The model is dimensionally consistent, as `A` carries the units of meters while all other terms (`omega*t`, `gamma*t`, and `sin`) combine to be dimensionless. A single dimensionless parameter, `param1`, is included to account for any overall scaling constants.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * omega * t * exp(-gamma * t) * abs(sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `omega` (natural frequency), `gamma` (damping coefficient), and `t` (time) are canonical for such systems. The output `x`, which is always positive and exhibits a \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" behavior after an initial stimulus, is likely not the oscillator's displacement but rather a measure of the energy or amplitude of its excited state. The observation that the maximum output can exceed the characteristic amplitude `A` points to a resonant amplification mechanism, where the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), related to the ratio `omega/gamma`, plays a crucial role.\\n\\nI propose a model of **\\\"Self-Inhibited Resonant Activation\\\"**. This theory posits that the damping mechanism, represented by `gamma`, has a dual function: it not only causes the eventual, inevitable decay of the system's excitation but also actively resists the initial build-up of the resonant state.\\n\\n1.  **Potential Amplitude and Resonant Gain:** The maximum amplitude the system can achieve is not simply `A`, but is amplified by the system's ability to resonate. This resonant gain is proportional to the Q-factor. Therefore, the potential peak amplitude scales with the dimensionless group `omega / gamma`. The overall scaling is set by `A`, leading to a potential amplitude term proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`. This term correctly predicts that a high-frequency, low-damping system will exhibit a much stronger response.\\n\\n2.  **Activation and Dissipation Dynamics:** After an initial impulse at `t=0`, the system's response `x` builds from zero. This activation is not instantaneous; it is a dynamic process that is fundamentally opposed by the system's own damping. We can model this as a first-order kinetic process, where the response approaches its potential. The fractional activation at time `t` is thus described by a saturating exponential term: `(1 - exp(-k * t))`. Crucially, the rate `k` of this activation process is governed by the same damping coefficient `gamma` that causes the final decay.\\n\\n    Simultaneously, the entire system is losing energy, causing the overall response to decay. This dissipation is modeled by the classic exponential decay envelope, `exp(-k * t)`. The core of the \\\"Self-Inhibition\\\" theory is that the same time constant governs both the resistance to activation and the long-term decay, as they both stem from the same underlying physical dissipative mechanism. This links the rise and fall of the response in a deeply physical way.\\n\\n3.  **The Combined Model:** The final observed response `x(t)` is the product of the potential amplitude and the combined activation/dissipation dynamics.

The key characteristics of the output `x`—its strict positivity, its rise from zero to a single peak followed by a decay, and its potential for amplification (peak value exceeding the input amplitude `A`)—guide the formulation of a new theoretical model. This model, which I term the **Phase-Saturated Impulse Response**, posits that the observed output is the product of a saturating phase-driven activation and an exponential energy decay.\\n\\n1.  **Excitation and Phase Evolution:** Upon receiving an impulse at `t=0`, the system is excited. In the abstract phase space of the oscillator (e.g., a plot of position vs. momentum), the state of the system begins to evolve. The primary characteristic of this evolution is rotation, the speed of which is governed by the system's natural angular frequency, `omega`. The total phase angle accumulated by time `t` is therefore proportional to `omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Saturated Observation of Phase:** We hypothesize that the measured quantity `x` is not the displacement itself but rather an observable that depends on this phase evolution in a saturating manner. As the phase angle `omega * t` increases from zero, the observable response grows. However, any real physical measurement or response mechanism has inherent limits and cannot grow indefinitely. The hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) function used in an example models one type of saturation, but another equally compelling physical model is one based on angular observation. The **arctangent function**, `arctan(z)`, provides a perfect mathematical analogy for such a process. It maps an input `z` that grows from zero to infinity (representing the cumulative phase `omega * t`) onto a bounded output that smoothly transitions from 0 to a finite limit (π/2). This `arctan(omega * t)` term elegantly models the system's \\\"ringing up\\\" phase, where the response grows rapidly at first and then smoothly saturates as it reaches its maximum activation level.\\n\\n3.  **Exponential Energy Decay:** Concurrently with the phase evolution, the total energy of the system is dissipated due to damping forces, a process characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This energy loss is universally modeled by an exponential decay factor, `exp(-k * gamma * t)`, which ensures that the system's response ultimately returns to zero as `t → ∞`.\\n\\n4.  **The Combined Response:** The observed output `x(t)` is the result of the interplay between the phase-driven activation and the energy decay. By modeling the response as the product of these two terms, scaled by the base amplitude `A`, we obtain a function that naturally reproduces the desired characteristics. The product of the monotonically increasing, saturating `arctan` function and the monotonically decreasing `exp` function yields a curve that starts at zero, rises to a single, well-defined peak, and then decays.\\n\\nThis model provides a clear mechanism for amplification. The peak of the response occurs when the rate of rise from the `arctan` term is balanced by the rate of fall from the `exp` term. A system with a high natural frequency `omega` and low damping `gamma` (a high Quality Factor) will cause the `arctan` term to approach its saturation value of π/2 very quickly, long before the `exp(-gamma * t)` term has significantly decreased. This results in a peak amplitude that can be a substantial multiple of the base amplitude `A`, consistent with the observed data. The model is also dimensionally sound, as `A` provides the units of meters, while all other functional components are dimensionless.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * arctan(omega * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The behavior of `x`—starting from a value near zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying asymptotically—is the classic signature of the *envelope* of a damped harmonic oscillator's response to an impulse at `t=0`. The fact that `x` is always positive confirms that it represents a non-oscillatory quantity like the magnitude of displacement or the stored energy, rather than the displacement itself.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the concept of **\\\"Power-Law Resonant Activation\\\"**. I posit that the observed response `x(t)` is the result of two fundamental, competing processes: a resonant energy accumulation process that causes the response to grow, and a dissipative process that causes it to decay.\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Dissipation:** Any real-world oscillator loses energy to its environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most fundamental mathematical description of this energy loss is an exponential decay. This dissipation acts as a time-dependent upper bound on the system's response, and it is modeled by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that for large `t`, the response always returns to zero.\\n\\n2.  **Power-Law Activation:** Following the initial stimulus at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It must undergo oscillations to absorb energy and build up a macroscopic response. The rate and manner of this build-up are intrinsically linked to its natural frequency, `omega`. I propose that the most natural measure of the system's progress in this activation phase is the total phase that has elapsed, `φ = omega * t`. This dimensionless quantity represents \\\"how much oscillation has occurred.\\\"\\n\\n    Unlike models that assume a saturating activation (like `arctan` or `tanh`), I theorize that the growth of the response envelope follows a more fundamental power-law relationship with the accumulated phase. The activation factor is thus modeled as `(omega * t)^n`. This functional form is incredibly versatile and physically significant, appearing in various phenomena from critical point physics to polymer chain growth.\\n    *   The term `(omega * t)` correctly captures that a higher frequency `omega` leads to a faster rise in the response.\\n    *   The exponent `n` (which we will represent as an optimizable parameter, `param2`) is a \\\"growth index\\\" that characterizes the non-linearity of the energy accumulation. An index of `n=1` would represent a simple linear accumulation, while other values allow for more complex, non-linear growth dynamics.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete expression for the response `x(t)` is the product of the base amplitude scale `A`, the power-law activation factor, and the exponential dissipation factor.\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (omega * t)^param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a robust physical narrative:\\n*   At `t=0`, the `(omega * t)` term is zero, so the response `x` correctly starts from zero.\\n*   For small `t`, the power-law term `(omega * t)^param2` dominates, causing the response to grow.\\n*   The response reaches its peak when the rate of growth from the power-law activation is perfectly balanced by the rate of decay from the exponential dissipation.\\n*   For large `t`, the exponential term `exp(-gamma * t)` overwhelms the power-law term, driving the system's response back to zero.\\n\\nThis \\\"Power-Law Activation\\\" model is dimensionally sound, as both `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless quantities, leaving the final result with the units of `A` (meters). An overall scaling parameter `param1` is included to account for proportionality constants.

The variables `A` (amplitude scale, meters), `gamma` (damping coefficient, s⁻¹), `omega` (natural angular frequency, s⁻¹), and `t` (time, seconds) are the canonical parameters for such a system. The target variable `x` (meters) represents a resulting physical quantity.\\n\\nA critical analysis of the data reveals two key characteristics that deviate from the simplest model of oscillator displacement (`y(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)`):\\n1.  **Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple displacement oscillates between positive and negative values.\\n2.  **Amplification:** The maximum output (`~27.7`) can significantly exceed the maximum input scale `A` (`~10.0`), indicating a mechanism for amplification that is absent in a simple decaying model.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the hypothesis that `x` does not represent the instantaneous displacement but rather the **time-varying amplitude envelope of an oscillator responding to an initial impulse.** A system excited by a sharp impulse at `t=0` (like a bell being struck) does not exhibit its maximum amplitude at that instant. Instead, the amplitude grows from zero, reaches a peak as energy permeates the system's oscillatory mode, and subsequently decays as energy is dissipated.\\n\\nThis physical narrative is mathematically captured by a function of the form `t * exp(-kt)`. My proposed model builds upon this structure:\\n\\n1.  **Initial Growth Phase:** The initial rate at which the amplitude grows is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout. This behavior is consistent with the observed data characteristics.\\n\\nCrucially, this model elegantly explains the amplification mechanism. The peak amplitude of this function occurs at `t_peak = 1/gamma` and its value is `x_peak = A * omega * (1/gamma) * exp(-1)`. This demonstrates that the maximum achievable amplitude is proportional to the dimensionless **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the system, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. A high-Q system (large `omega`, small `gamma`) will exhibit a strong resonant response, leading to a peak amplitude significantly greater than the characteristic scale `A`, thus resolving the amplification anomaly.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of `m`, while `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless products, ensuring `x` has the correct units of meters. Introducing a dimensionless parameter `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` for fine-tuning the decay rate provides the necessary flexibility to fit the experimental data precisely.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * omega * t * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

This energy loss is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most natural mathematical representation for this process is an exponential decay function, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term correctly models the long-term behavior where the system's excitation fades away, ensuring `x` approaches zero as `t` becomes large.\\n\\n2.  **Activation Process:** When the system is stimulated at `t=0`, its response is not instantaneous.

Many physical systems exhibit this behavior, where the response rate is initially high but then levels off as the system approaches its maximum capacity.

It starts at `0` and gracefully rises to an asymptote at `1`.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the rate of this activation is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`.
