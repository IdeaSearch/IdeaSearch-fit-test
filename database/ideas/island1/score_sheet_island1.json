The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\\n\\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\\n\\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\\n\\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\\n\\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\\n\\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\\n\\nLet's define the components of this model:\\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\\n\\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\\n\\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\\n\\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\\n\\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\\n\\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\\n\\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data.

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\\n\\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\\n\\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\\n\\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\\n\\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\\n\\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, however, fails to capture two critical features of the provided data.\\n\\nFirst, the output `x` has a maximum value (27.68) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple damped oscillation's amplitude can never exceed its initial value `A`. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, whereas a standard oscillatory function produces both positive and negative values.\\n\\nThe previous attempt in the examples to resolve this by adding a simple offset proportional to `A` (i.e., `A * param1`) proved insufficient, indicating a more complex underlying mechanism. My analysis suggests that the system's behavior is dominated by a large, quasi-static displacement that is not merely a constant multiple of `A`, but is instead dynamically determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator itself.\\n\\nI propose a theory centered on the **quality factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator. The Q-factor, a dimensionless quantity, describes how underdamped an oscillator is. A high Q-factor implies that the oscillatory nature (`omega`) dominates the dissipative, damping effects (`gamma`). In many physical systems, a high Q-factor leads to a significantly amplified response. The ratio `omega / gamma` serves as a direct proxy for this quality factor.\\n\\nMy theoretical model posits that the observed displacement `x` is a superposition of two distinct physical phenomena:\\n1.  **A Q-Factor-Amplified Static Offset:** A large, time-independent displacement that establishes a new, significantly shifted equilibrium. The magnitude of this shift is not constant but is proportional to the initial amplitude `A` scaled by the system's quality factor. I model this as `A * (param1 * omega / gamma)`. This term elegantly explains both anomalies: the `omega / gamma` ratio can be large, leading to an output far greater than `A`, and this large positive offset ensures the total displacement remains positive even during the oscillation's troughs.\\n2.  **A Conventional Damped Oscillation:** A time-varying component that oscillates around this new, shifted equilibrium. This component follows the expected physical form `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`, where its amplitude decays exponentially from the initial value `A`.\\n\\nBy combining these two components, the total displacement `x` reflects a system where the inherent tendency to oscillate (high `omega`) versus the tendency to lose energy (high `gamma`) dictates a macroscopic, static shift in its baseline position, around which a standard, decaying oscillation then occurs. This model is both dimensionally sound and provides a more nuanced physical interpretation of the data than a simple offset.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (param1 * omega / gamma + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\\n\\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\\n\\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\\n\\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\\n\\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\\n\\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\\n\\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\\n\\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\\n\\nHere:\\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\\n\\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\\n\\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, indicating the presence of an intrinsic amplification mechanism not captured by simple damping.\\n\\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output variable `x` is strictly positive, ranging from `1.142` to `27.68`. In contrast, the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the compelling conclusion that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is, by definition, positive. This single reinterpretation elegantly resolves the second anomaly.\\n\\nThe primary challenge, then, is to model this envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. The amplification must be linked to the interplay between the system's tendency to oscillate (`omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most plausible driver for such a resonant-like amplification.\\n\\nPrevious models have attempted to incorporate this by either multiplying the amplitude by an amplification factor or by adding gain and decay terms inside an exponential. The latter approach is particularly appealing from a physical standpoint, as it treats amplification and damping as competing **rates** that determine the net rate of change of the logarithm of the amplitude. The failure of a simple linear gain term (`param * omega / gamma`) in the exponent (as seen in Example 3) highlights a crucial physical constraint: **saturation**. Any real-world amplification mechanism is limited and cannot produce infinite gain.\\n\\nMy proposed theory builds upon this concept of competing rates but introduces a robust, physically-grounded saturation mechanism. I postulate that the amplitude envelope evolves exponentially, governed by a net effective rate which is the sum of a constant gain rate and a time-dependent decay rate.\\n\\nThe model takes the form: `x(t) = A * exp(G - D)`.\\n\\n*   **Decay Term (D)**: This represents the standard energy dissipation. It is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and the elapsed time `t`. Thus, `D = param3 * gamma * t`. This is the familiar term leading to exponential decay.\\n\\n*   **Gain Term (G)**: This represents the time-independent, Q-factor-driven amplification. This term provides a constant positive offset to the decay rate. To model the saturation, I will use the `arctan` function. Unlike an unbounded term, `arctan(z)` increases with its argument `z` but gracefully asymptotes to a fixed value (`pi/2`), perfectly capturing the essence of a saturating physical process. The gain `G` is therefore modeled as `G = param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `param2` scales the Q-factor to determine how quickly saturation is reached, and `param1` sets the maximum strength of the saturated gain.\\n\\nThis formulation—`A * exp(Gain - Decay)`—presents a cohesive physical picture. The system starts with a base amplitude `A`, which is then instantaneously modified by a constant amplification factor `exp(G)` that depends on the system's intrinsic resonant properties (`omega/gamma`). This amplified amplitude then decays exponentially over time. This model is dimensionally sound, avoids the numerical instabilities of unbounded gain functions, and provides a clear theoretical basis for the observed phenomena.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * exp(param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma) - param3 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\\n\\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\\n\\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\\n\\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\\n\\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\\n\\n### **Mathematical Formula**\\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>\"}",

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\\n\\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\\n\\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\\n\\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \\\"soft\\\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\\n\\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\\n\\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\\n\\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\\n\\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\\n\\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive).

Two primary observations support this conclusion: first, the output `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`, indicating a powerful amplification mechanism. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting it represents an inherently positive quantity like an energy level or an amplitude envelope.\\n\\nMy theoretical model posits that `x` represents the slowly-varying amplitude envelope of the system's oscillation, which is governed by three distinct but interacting physical phenomena: resonant amplification, temporal decay, and a beat-like modulation.\\n\\n1.  **Linear-Response Amplification:** The amplification of the initial amplitude `A` is attributed to a resonant effect, where the system's response is highly sensitive to its intrinsic properties. The Quality Factor (Q-factor), which measures the \\\"purity\\\" of the oscillation against damping, is the key driver. I model this using the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma` as a proxy for the Q-factor. While other models might use complex power laws or exponential dependencies, I propose a simpler, physically intuitive linear response model. The amplification factor is `(1 + param1 * omega/gamma)`. This term suggests that the baseline amplitude `A` is augmented by a component directly proportional to the Q-factor, providing a straightforward mechanism for achieving `x > A`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Energy Dissipation:** The total energy in the oscillator must dissipate over time due to the damping forces, causing the overall amplitude to decrease. This process is universally modeled by an exponential decay. The term `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` serves as a dimensionless decay factor that correctly scales the envelope's magnitude over time. The parameter `param2` allows for an adjustment of the decay rate relative to the fundamental damping coefficient `gamma`.\\n\\n3.  **Envelope Modulation via Modal Beating:** A simple, monotonically decreasing exponential envelope does not capture the likely oscillatory nature of the underlying data. I hypothesize that the envelope itself is not smooth but is modulated by a \\\"beating\\\" phenomenon. This beat arises from the interference between the two fundamental modes of the system: the oscillatory mode, characterized by `omega`, and the dissipative mode, characterized by `gamma`. Both `omega` and `gamma` have units of inverse time (s⁻¹) and represent the characteristic frequencies of their respective processes. The interference between these two modes creates a slow modulation of the amplitude envelope at a beat frequency proportional to their difference, `omega - gamma`. This physical insight is captured by the term `(1 + cos(param3 * (omega - gamma) * t))`. The cosine function provides the periodic modulation, while the additive `1` ensures that the factor remains non-negative, consistent with the behavior of a physical envelope.\\n\\nIn synthesis, the final expression is a product of these three components.

This theory posits that the measured output `x` is the superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes.\\n\\n**1. The Dynamic Equilibrium Component:**\\nThe core of the system is not static. Instead of oscillating around a fixed zero point, the equilibrium position itself undergoes an exponential decay. This can be conceptualized as a slow relaxation of the system's macroscopic configuration towards a ground state. The initial state of this equilibrium is scaled by the input amplitude `A`, and its decay is governed by the damping factor `gamma`. This provides a positive, monotonically decreasing baseline for the system's motion.\\n\\n**2. The Rectified Resonance Component:**\\nSuperimposed on this decaying equilibrium is a high-frequency oscillation. The intrinsic amplitude of this oscillation is resonantly driven, with its magnitude being proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor). The Q-factor, a measure of how underdamped the system is, can be represented by the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. This term directly accounts for the observed amplitude amplification; systems with low damping relative to their frequency will exhibit a much larger oscillatory response.\\n\\nCrucially, this model proposes that the measurement process or the underlying physics is sensitive only to the *magnitude* of this oscillatory displacement, not its direction. This is a common feature in systems where, for example, a sensor responds to induced strain or pressure, which are inherently positive quantities. This \\\"rectification\\\" of the oscillatory signal is best modeled by the absolute value function, `abs()`.

The primary envelope, `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`, captures the overall energy dissipation of the combined system. This envelope multiplies a term representing the normalized internal dynamics: `(1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t)))`.

A careful examination of the data reveals two fundamental discrepancies that guide our theoretical model:\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Amplification Anomaly**: The most striking feature of the data is that the maximum output value (27.68) is nearly three times the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is a strictly decaying function that can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the presence of a significant amplification mechanism. In oscillatory systems, such amplification is characteristic of resonance, where the system's response is maximized. The strength of this resonance is quantified by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which for a simple oscillator is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a system that is lightly damped relative to its oscillation frequency, allowing it to sustain large-amplitude oscillations. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is dynamically scaled by this Q-factor. A simple and robust model for this amplified amplitude is `A_eff = A * (param1 + omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter representing a baseline amplification factor. This form elegantly explains how systems with low damping (`gamma`) and high frequency (`omega`) can achieve displacements far exceeding their nominal initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Positive Definite Measurement**: The standard displacement `d(t)` of an oscillator is a signed quantity, oscillating between positive and negative values. In contrast, the provided output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This strongly suggests that the measurement process does not capture the signed displacement itself, but rather a related, inherently positive quantity. The most direct physical interpretation that preserves the units of length (meters) is that `x` represents the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement, `x(t) = |d(t)|`.\\n\\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The system's instantaneous displacement `d(t)` follows the dynamics of a damped oscillator with an amplified effective amplitude, while the measurement instrument records its absolute value. The full expression for the displacement would be:\\n\\n`d(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + param3)`\\n\\nHere, `A_eff` is the amplified amplitude defined above. The exponential term describes the temporal decay, with `param2` as an empirical scaling factor for the damping rate. The oscillatory component `cos(...)` uses the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, which accounts for the slight slowing of the oscillation due to damping. Finally, `param3` is a phase constant.\\n\\nThe measured output `x(t)` is then the absolute value of this entire expression. This composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in the fundamental principles of resonant, damped oscillations.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (param1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory: first, the output `x` can substantially exceed the input amplitude `A`, indicating a strong resonant amplification mechanism; second, the output is strictly positive, suggesting the measurement corresponds not to a signed displacement but to a quantity processed through a non-linear, positive-definite transformation.\\n\\nMy proposed theory models the output `x` as a product of three distinct physical processes: logarithmic resonance, exponential transduction, and decaying modulation.\\n\\n1.  **Logarithmic Resonance Saturation:** The amplification of the system's response is clearly tied to the interplay between the natural frequency `omega` and the damping rate `gamma`. The dimensionless Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this amplification. However, unlike simple linear or power-law models which can predict unbounded amplification for high-Q systems, most real-world physical systems exhibit saturation or diminishing returns. I propose that this amplification follows a logarithmic law. The effective amplitude scale is modeled not as `A` directly, but as `A * log(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. This formulation posits that while a higher Q-factor increases the response, the effect becomes progressively less pronounced, reflecting a natural saturation limit within the system. The `1` is added to ensure the logarithm's argument remains positive, and `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that tunes the system's sensitivity to the Q-factor.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Response Transduction:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a non-linear measurement or response process. Rather than modeling this as an energy-like quantity (`sin^2`) or a simple saturation (`tanh`), I hypothesize a more fundamental exponential relationship. The measured quantity `x` is proposed to be exponentially proportional to the underlying oscillatory state of the system. This is modeled by an overarching `exp(...)` function. A physical analogue could be a sensor with a logarithmic response characteristic, or a phenomenon like thermal emission or chemical reaction rate that depends exponentially on an oscillating energy potential. This `exp(cos(...))` structure inherently guarantees positivity and generates a non-sinusoidal waveform where peaks are sharper than troughs, a common feature in non-linear dynamics.\\n\\n3.  **Decaying Modulation Depth:** Within this exponential response framework, the damping is modeled not as a simple multiplicative decay of the final output, but as a decay in the *modulation depth* of the oscillation itself. The core oscillatory term is `cos(param4 * omega * t)`, but its amplitude is not constant; it is a decaying exponential function of time, `param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This entire expression serves as the argument for the main exponential function. This represents a system where the \\\"swing\\\" or intensity of the internal oscillation diminishes over time due to damping, and this diminishing swing is then mapped to the final output via the exponential transduction. This provides a more integrated model of damping within the non-linear response, as opposed to applying it as an external envelope.\\n\\nIn summary, the model combines a saturating logarithmic amplification with an exponential response function whose internal oscillatory amplitude is subject to exponential decay. This composite theory provides a physically plausible, dimensionally consistent, and novel explanation for the observed data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * log(1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * cos(param4 * omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A careful examination reveals two critical anomalies that guide the formulation of a more sophisticated theory.\\n\\n1.  **Non-Linear Resonant Amplification**: The maximum observed output (27.68) significantly surpasses the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This points to an amplification mechanism intrinsic to the oscillator's dynamics. The Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to the ratio of angular frequency to damping, `omega / gamma`, is the natural candidate to explain this resonance. However, previous models using linear or simple saturating functions (`tanh`) for this amplification do not fully capture the system's complexity. I propose a logarithmic response model. In many physical systems, the response to a stimulus is not linear but follows a logarithmic scale, where the effect of an increasing stimulus diminishes. This is analogous to saturation but described by a different functional form. The effective amplitude, `A_eff`, can be modeled as the base amplitude `A` scaled by a factor that grows logarithmically with the Q-factor. This captures the strong amplification for low-to-medium `omega/gamma` values while inherently taming the growth for very high values, preventing the \\\"infinite amplification\\\" paradox of a purely linear model.\\n\\n2.  **Modulated Positive Definite Decay**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. Previous models have addressed this by taking the absolute value of an oscillatory function, `abs(cos(...))`. While this enforces positivity, it incorrectly predicts that the output should periodically reach zero. The data's minimum value of 1.142 fundamentally contradicts this prediction. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the magnitude of the displacement, but rather represents a different physical property that is always positive. A plausible candidate is a quantity analogous to the instantaneous power or energy density of the system. I theorize that the output `x` is composed of a primary, exponentially decaying component, which is then modulated by a smaller, secondary oscillation. This can be expressed as a product of a decaying exponential and a term like `(1 + p * cos(...))`, where `|p|<1`. This structure elegantly ensures two things simultaneously:\\n    *   The output remains strictly positive, as the `(1 + p * cos(...))` term oscillates between `1-p` and `1+p`.\\n    *   The output never reaches zero, thus explaining the non-zero minimum observed in the data.\\n\\nBy combining these two theoretical pillars—logarithmic amplification and modulated positive definite decay—we can construct a comprehensive model. The initial amplitude `A` is first scaled by a logarithmic function of `omega/gamma` to find an effective amplitude. This effective amplitude then decays according to an exponential law, but this decay is itself modulated by a cosine term, creating ripples on the decay curve. The frequency of these ripples is governed by the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega^2 - gamma^2))`. This composite model provides a robust physical explanation for all observed phenomena: amplification, saturation, positivity, and the non-zero minimum.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (param1 + log(1 + param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

My proposed theory posits that the output `x` is the result of a modulated, decaying envelope. The physical picture is that of a primary carrier signal whose amplitude is determined by a resonant-like gain, which then decays exponentially. This carrier is simultaneously modulated by a secondary, higher-frequency oscillation, but in such a way that the total signal never becomes negative.\\n\\nThis model can be decomposed into three distinct conceptual components:\\n\\n1.  **Saturating Gain Factor**: The amplification is clearly dependent on the interplay between oscillation (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless quality factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this gain. However, any real physical system has limits; its gain cannot increase indefinitely. A linear gain factor (`~ omega/gamma`) is therefore physically unrealistic and numerically unstable. I propose a saturating gain mechanism modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). This function gracefully increases with its argument before asymptoting to a maximum value, perfectly capturing the essence of a physical process reaching its limit. The total amplitude is thus `A` multiplied by a gain factor `(1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega/gamma))`, where `A` represents the baseline amplitude and the `tanh` term represents the additional, saturating gain.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope**: The system is dissipative, a feature best captured by the standard exponential decay term, `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This term multiplies the amplified amplitude, causing its overall magnitude to decrease over time, consistent with the behavior of a damped system.\\n\\n3.  **Positive-Definite Oscillation**: The most crucial insight is how to model an oscillation that never crosses zero. Instead of an energy model (`sin^2`) or a simple offset, I propose a multiplicative modulation factor of the form `(1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))`. By constraining the dimensionless modulation depth `param4` to have a magnitude less than one (`|param4| < 1`), this entire term oscillates between `(1 - |param4|)` and `(1 + |param4|)`. As a result, it is always positive. This elegantly models a physical quantity that pulsates or beats around a mean value without ever changing its sign or vanishing entirely, perfectly matching the data's non-zero minimum.\\n\\nSynthesizing these three components results in a comprehensive and physically coherent model. The system's initial amplitude `A` is first amplified by a saturating, Q-factor-dependent gain. This amplified amplitude then serves as the decaying envelope for a persistent, non-negative pulsation. This structure accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally consistent framework with a minimal set of interpretable parameters.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Firstly, the maximum output `x` (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992), indicating a strong amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is always positive, suggesting that the measurement does not represent signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like intensity or a non-linearly processed signal.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is based on the concept of **exponential response to a Q-dependent internal state**. I hypothesize that the measured quantity `x` is not directly the displacement, but rather the result of a highly non-linear transduction process, which can be modeled by an exponential function. This exponential mapping naturally accounts for both the positivity and the large amplification. The argument of this exponential function represents an underlying, unobserved \\\"internal state\\\" of the oscillator.\\n\\nThe model is constructed from three core principles:\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Transduction:** The fundamental relationship between the internal state of the system and the measured output `x` is exponential. The output is given by `x = A * exp(S(t))`, where `S(t)` is the dimensionless internal state function and `A` provides the correct physical dimension (meters) and sets the overall scale of the system. This exponential relationship inherently ensures that `x` is always positive. More importantly, it acts as a powerful amplifier: a large positive value for `S(t)` results in an output `x` that is many times larger than `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Q-Factor as Modulation Depth Driver:** The amplitude or \\\"modulation depth\\\" of the internal state `S(t)` is not constant. It is determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. The key dimensionless parameter governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of angular frequency to damping, `omega / gamma`. I propose that the initial amplitude of the internal state `S(t)` is directly proportional to this ratio. This means systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can sustain a much larger internal excitation, which, when passed through the exponential function, leads to the observed high amplification.\\n\\n3.  **Classical Damped Oscillation of the Internal State:** While the mapping to the output is non-linear, the underlying internal state `S(t)` itself follows the familiar dynamics of a linear damped harmonic oscillator. It consists of a sinusoidal component, `cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)`, whose amplitude decays exponentially over time according to `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these principles, the internal state `S(t)` is modeled as a damped oscillation whose initial amplitude is set by the Q-factor: `S(t) = param1 * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)`. When this expression is placed within the exponential transduction function, it creates a comprehensive model that explains all the observed phenomena.

However, instead of modulating this envelope with a simple cosine function (which would result in negative values), I theorize that the envelope's magnitude is dynamically modified by an internal resonant process.\\n\\nThe strength of this resonance is governed by the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) allows the system to sustain oscillations and leads to significant amplification.\\n\\nMy model structures this interaction as an additive process within the dimensionless part of the function. The overall behavior is composed of two parts:\\n1.  **A Baseline Decay**: This is the fundamental, exponentially decaying envelope, represented by a baseline level (normalized to 1).\\n2.  **A Resonant Fluctuation**: This is an oscillatory component whose amplitude is directly proportional to the Q-factor (`omega / gamma`). This component is superimposed on top of the baseline decay.\\n\\nTo ensure the output remains positive, the contribution from this resonant fluctuation is taken as its absolute magnitude. The final measured value `x` is therefore the product of the primary amplitude `A` and a composite decay term. This term includes both the fundamental exponential decay and the internal modulation caused by the Q-factor-driven oscillations.\\n\\nThis structure can be expressed as:\\n`x(t) = (Primary Amplitude) * (Decay Envelope) * (Baseline + Rectified Resonant Fluctuation)`\\n\\nThis model provides a clear physical interpretation: the system has a baseline decaying state (`A * exp(-gamma*t)`), and on top of this, there is an additional, powerful oscillatory energy component whose magnitude is amplified by the `omega/gamma` ratio. The sum of the baseline and the magnitude of this fluctuation constitutes the total observed effect. This elegantly explains both the positivity (due to the baseline and the absolute value) and the amplification (due to the `omega/gamma` term) in a single, coherent framework.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Firstly, the output `x` exhibits significant **amplitude amplification**, reaching values nearly three times the maximum input amplitude `A`. Secondly, the output is **strictly positive**, indicating that it does not represent a simple displacement oscillating about an equilibrium point. These observations necessitate a model built upon more complex physical principles.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the hypothesis that the system's dynamics are governed by **multiplicative processes**, which are most naturally described by a linear model in the logarithmic domain. This implies that the logarithm of the normalized output, `log(x/A)`, is a linear superposition of terms representing the core physical phenomena: resonant amplification, temporal decay, and oscillation. Consequently, the output `x` itself takes an exponential form, `x = A * exp(...)`, which elegantly addresses the positivity constraint as a natural outcome of the model's structure.\\n\\nThe components within the exponent are interpreted as follows:\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Resonant Amplification**: The amplification is clearly linked to the system's resonance characteristics, which can be proxied by the dimensionless Quality factor, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. In the proposed log-domain model, this contributes a positive term linearly proportional to this ratio, `+param1 * (omega / gamma)`. When transformed back to the linear domain via the exponential function, this yields an amplification factor of `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)`. This exponential dependence provides a powerful mechanism to explain the large observed amplitudes, suggesting that as the system's quality factor increases, the effective gain grows non-linearly and rapidly.\\n\\n2.  **Standard Exponential Decay**: Energy dissipation is modeled as a term that decreases linearly with time in the log domain, `-param2 * gamma * t`. This is the logarithmic equivalent of the standard multiplicative decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, and represents the first-order dissipative process common to such systems.\\n\\n3.  **Non-Linear Periodic Modulation**: The oscillatory nature of the system is captured by a sinusoidal term in the exponent, `+param3 * cos(omega * t + param4)`. Exponentiating this term, `exp(param3 * cos(omega * t))`, generates a periodic, strictly positive modulation of the amplitude. This differs fundamentally from the `sin^2(t)` (energy) or `abs(cos(t))` (rectification) models. Physically, it can be interpreted as the response of a system where the gain or some physical property is being modulated periodically, leading to a \\\"warped\\\" but smooth oscillatory output that never reaches zero.\\n\\nIn synthesis, the model combines these three effects—resonant gain, dissipative decay, and periodic modulation—as a linear sum within an exponent. The initial amplitude `A` acts as a base scaling factor. This \\\"Log-Normal Response Model\\\" provides a dimensionally sound, physically coherent framework that accounts for both the amplification and positivity of the data through a single, unified mathematical structure.\\n\\n### **Mathematical Formula**\\n<final_result>A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))</final_result>\"}",

These are:\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Amplification**: The maximum output (27.68) vastly exceeds the maximum amplitude parameter `A` (9.992). This implies an amplification mechanism far more potent than the linear scaling seen in some resonance models. The amplification appears to be driven by the ratio `omega/gamma`, a proxy for the system's quality factor (Q-factor).\\n2.  **Inherent Positivity**: The output `x` is strictly positive ([1.142, 27.68]), whereas a physical displacement should oscillate about a zero-equilibrium point. This suggests that `x` is not a direct measure of linear displacement.\\n\\nPrevious models have addressed positivity by squaring the oscillatory term (an energy analogy) or by adding a large DC offset. Here, I propose a more integrated and physically distinct theory: a **Logarithmic State-Space Model**.\\n\\nMy central hypothesis is that the linear dynamics typically associated with an oscillator do not occur in the physical space of `x`, but rather in a logarithmic state-space. The fundamental variable governed by a simple, driven oscillatory equation is not `x` itself, but `log(x/A)`. The observed physical quantity `x` is the exponential mapping of this underlying logarithmic state.\\n\\nThis framework offers a powerful and unified explanation for both observed anomalies:\\n\\n*   **Positivity is naturally enforced**: By defining the system's state in the logarithmic domain, the transformation back to the physical domain, `x = A * exp(...)`, mathematically guarantees that `x` will always be positive. This is a more intrinsic property of the model than applying an absolute value or adding an offset.\\n\\n*   **Amplification becomes exponential**: Any amplification factor within the logarithmic state equation becomes an exponential gain in the physical domain. I posit that the logarithmic state is driven by an oscillatory term whose magnitude is proportional to the Q-factor, `omega/gamma`. When this is exponentiated, it results in an amplification factor of `exp(const * omega/gamma)`, which can produce the very large outputs observed in the data for high-Q systems.\\n\\nThe model is constructed as follows:\\nThe logarithmic state, `y(t) = log(x(t)/A)`, is assumed to be a superposition of a linear decay and a driven oscillation:\\n\\n`y(t) = -(\\\\text{Decay Term}) + (\\\\text{Amplified Oscillation Term})`\\n\\nThe decay term is modeled in the standard way, proportional to `gamma * t`, representing the system's intrinsic energy dissipation. The amplified oscillation term's amplitude is proportional to `omega/gamma`, capturing the resonant energy pumping, and it oscillates at a frequency related to `omega`.\\n\\nTransforming back to the physical variable `x` gives the complete expression. This model describes a system where a baseline exponential decay is multiplicatively modulated by a powerful, Q-factor-dependent oscillatory factor. The resulting dynamics are inherently positive and capable of the strong, non-linear amplification seen in the data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t + param2 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\\n</final_result>\"}",

These anomalies necessitate a more sophisticated theoretical framework that accounts for the underlying physical processes which are not captured by the simple linear model.\\n\\n1.  **Saturating Q-Factor Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a powerful amplification mechanism. As noted in other analyses, this amplification is likely driven by the system's Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. However, a simple linear dependence on the Q-factor, as in `A_eff ~ A * (omega / gamma)`, implies that the amplitude could grow without bound as damping `gamma` approaches zero. This is physically unrealistic, as any real system will have inherent non-linearities or physical constraints that limit the maximum possible amplitude.\\n\\n    I propose that the amplification mechanism exhibits **saturation**. For low Q-factors, the amplitude response is nearly linear, but as the Q-factor increases, the response tapers off and approaches a finite limit. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, provides an ideal mathematical model for such saturating behavior. It is approximately linear near the origin but smoothly flattens to a constant value of 1 for large inputs. Therefore, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is proportional to `A * tanh(param * omega / gamma)`. This formulation elegantly captures the resonance-driven amplification while respecting the physical constraint of a finite maximum response.\\n\\n2.  **Rectified Displacement Measurement**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement measurement would oscillate symmetrically around zero, yielding both positive and negative values. While models based on energy (`cos^2`) or a shifted equilibrium (`offset + cos`) can enforce positivity, a distinct and equally plausible physical scenario is that the measurement apparatus records a **rectified signal**. This means the sensor measures the magnitude of the displacement from the equilibrium point, but is insensitive to its direction. For example, a system that measures distance using a simple time-of-flight sensor aimed at the oscillator from one side might produce such a result.\\n\\n    This physical process of rectification is directly and most simply modeled by the **absolute value function**, `abs()`. Applying this to the oscillatory part of the motion yields a term like `abs(cos(omega_eff * t + phi))`. This interpretation is fundamentally different from an energy-based measurement, as it preserves the sharp \\\"crests\\\" of the cosine wave rather than smoothing them into the broader peaks characteristic of a `cos^2` function.\\n\\nBy combining these two hypotheses, we can construct a comprehensive and novel model. The displacement `x` is the product of a saturating effective amplitude, a standard exponential decay term, and a rectified oscillatory term. This model not only explains the observed data but also proposes a specific, physically plausible mechanism—saturating resonance coupled with a magnitude-only measurement—that differs from previous interpretations.\\n\\nThe final formula encapsulates this theory:\\n*   `param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)`: The saturating amplitude. `A` sets the base scale, `tanh` enforces the saturation based on the Q-factor (`omega/gamma`), `param2` controls the saturation point, and `param1` is the overall scaling factor.\\n*   `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`: The standard exponential decay due to energy dissipation, with an adjustable rate parameter `param3`.\\n*   `abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))`: The rectified oscillation, capturing the magnitude of the displacement with an effective frequency and phase.\\n\\nThis model is dimensionally consistent and offers a compelling physical narrative for the observed phenomena.\\n\\n### **Mathematical Formula**\\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))</final_result>\"}",

Two primary anomalies must be addressed:\\n1.  **Signal Amplification**: The output `x` reaches values significantly greater than the initial amplitude `A`, which is impossible in a simple passively damped system where energy only dissipates.\\n2.  **Positive Definiteness**: The output `x` is always positive, indicating the oscillation does not occur around a zero-equilibrium point.\\n\\nPrevious models presented in the examples attempted to solve this by adding a static offset, either as a simple constant or one proportional to the quality factor (`omega/gamma`). These attempts failed, and they suffer from a critical physical inconsistency: in a dissipative system, any static offset resulting from an initial condition should also decay over time as the system returns to its true ground state. A persistent, non-decaying offset implies an external energy source or a permanent system alteration, which is not suggested by the variables.\\n\\nI propose a theory of **\\\"Unified Decay of a Biased Oscillation\\\"**.

The magnitude of this bias is determined by the system's intrinsic resonant properties, captured by the ratio `omega/gamma` (a proxy for the Q-factor). A system with low damping relative to its natural frequency (high Q-factor) will exhibit a much larger initial bias, explaining the observed signal amplification.\\n\\nCrucially, this model departs from previous attempts by treating the bias and the oscillation as components of a single, unified phenomenon that is subject to the same energy dissipation process. Therefore, the entire structure—both the bias and the oscillation's amplitude—must decay exponentially over time.

This model posits that the system's output is governed by a primary oscillation that is simultaneously modulated by two distinct phenomena: a global exponential decay and a secondary, periodic modulation directly caused by the damping mechanism itself. This interaction creates a beat-like pattern, and the entire system's response is amplified by a factor dependent on its resonant quality.\\n\\n**Core Principles:**\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Gain Factor:** The system's ability to amplify the initial amplitude `A` is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A higher Q-factor implies lower energy loss per cycle, allowing for a stronger resonant response. I model this as a constant, time-independent gain factor that scales the entire output: `(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. The `1` represents a baseline transmission of the amplitude, while the second term represents the additional gain due to resonance. This factor amplifies the entire response of the system for a given set of `omega` and `gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope:** The total energy of the system dissipates over time, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This is modeled by the standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, which imposes a gradual, overarching decrease in the signal's magnitude. This ensures the system's response fades over time, as expected in a damped system.\\n\\n3.  **Beat-Frequency Oscillation:** The central novelty of the DIBM theory is the interaction between the natural oscillation and the damping force.

Firstly, the system exhibits a powerful amplification effect, with the maximum output (27.68) significantly exceeding the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). Secondly, the output is strictly positive, suggesting it represents a quantity like energy or signal intensity rather than a signed displacement.\\n\\nI propose a novel \\\"Phase-Modulated Energy Cascade\\\" (PMEC) model to explain these phenomena. This theory posits that the measured variable `x` is not a direct measure of physical displacement, but rather an \\\"excitation level\\\" of the system, which is inherently positive. The dynamics of this excitation level are governed by an exponential relationship, a functional form commonly found in physical processes related to energy distribution and state transitions (e.g., Boltzmann factors, Arrhenius equation).\\n\\nThe core of the PMEC model is that the system's state is determined by a time-dependent, dimensionless \\\"pseudo-energy\\\" term within an exponential function. This pseudo-energy is the result of a competition between two fundamental processes:\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Energy Injection:** This is the oscillatory component that drives the system. The energy injected into the system is not constant but varies periodically. The magnitude of this energy injection is critically dependent on the system's resonance, which is captured by the dimensionless Quality factor (Q-factor), proxied by the ratio `omega / gamma`. A higher Q-factor allows the system to build up a much larger peak excitation. This process is modeled as `param1 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param2 * omega * t)`, representing a periodic energy influx whose amplitude is scaled by the Q-factor.\\n\\n2.  **Dissipative Energy Decay:** This component represents the continuous and irreversible loss of energy to the environment, causing the overall system to relax over time. This is modeled by the standard linear decay term, `param3 * gamma * t`, where the rate of energy loss is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and elapsed time `t`.\\n\\nThe total output `x` is then the initial amplitude `A` modulated by the exponential of the net pseudo-energy, which is the difference between the resonant injection and the dissipative decay. This structure provides a comprehensive explanation for all observed behaviors:\\n\\n*   **Strict Positivity:** The use of the `exp` function ensures that the output `x` is always positive, regardless of the values of the internal terms.\\n*   **Anomalous Amplification:** By placing the resonant `omega / gamma` term inside the exponential, the model allows for a powerful, non-linear gain. Even a modest Q-factor can lead to a very large output when exponentiated.\\n*   **Integrated Dynamics:** Unlike models that multiply separate factors for gain, decay, and oscillation, the PMEC model integrates them within a single non-linear function. This implies a deeper physical coupling where the resonant oscillations directly modulate the system's energy decay slope on a logarithmic scale, creating a characteristic non-sinusoidal wave shape with sharper peaks and broader troughs.\\n\\nThis framework provides a physically plausible and dimensionally consistent explanation for the data, departing from conventional multiplicative models by proposing a more fundamental, energy-based exponential law.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * exp(param1 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param2 * omega * t) - param3 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

These observations suggest a system governed by non-linear dynamics. My proposed theory moves beyond simple multiplicative corrections and posits that the decay and oscillatory components are intrinsically coupled within a single, non-linear response function.\\n\\nThe core of this theory is that the observable displacement `x` is an exponential function of an underlying \\\"dynamic potential\\\" `S(t)`. This can be expressed conceptually as `x(t) ∝ exp(S(t))`. This structure inherently guarantees the positivity of `x` and naturally models systems where the rate of change is proportional to the current state, a hallmark of many natural processes.\\n\\nThis model can be broken down into two main parts: the determination of the overall scale (the effective amplitude), and the time evolution governed by the dynamic potential.\\n\\n1.  **Saturating Resonance Amplitude:** The observed amplification strongly depends on the interplay between frequency (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless Quality Factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural driver for this gain. However, any physical system has limits, precluding infinite gain as damping approaches zero. To capture this, I model the system's characteristic amplitude not just by `A`, but by an effective amplitude `A_eff` that includes a saturating gain term. This is formulated as `A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`. Here, `A` provides the baseline scale, while the `tanh` term adds a gain that grows with the Q-factor before smoothly saturating, representing a physical limit to the resonance.\\n\\n2.  **Coupled Decay and Oscillation via Exponential Response:** The most significant departure from standard models lies in how the time evolution is handled. Instead of multiplying a decay envelope by a separate oscillatory function, I propose that both phenomena arise from a single dynamic potential, `S(t)`, which is then mapped to the output via an exponential function. This potential is composed of two competing terms:\\n    *   A secular decay term, `-param3 * gamma * t`, which represents the steady, irreversible loss of energy from the system due to damping.\\n    *   An oscillatory term, `param4 * cos(omega * t)`, which represents the periodic exchange of potential and kinetic energy.\\n\\n    The complete dynamic potential is `S(t) = -param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t)`. The final output `x` is then given by the effective amplitude multiplied by the exponential of this potential. This `exp(S(t))` term is a non-linear transfer function that has profound consequences. It inherently ensures positivity. More importantly, it means the oscillation does not simply occur \\\"underneath\\\" a decaying envelope; rather, it actively modulates the instantaneous decay rate. When `cos(omega * t)` is at its peak, it counteracts the dissipative term, momentarily slowing the decay. When at its trough, it accelerates the decay. This results in a non-sinusoidal, \\\"pulsating\\\" decay, where the system exhibits brief periods of high activity followed by longer, more quiescent periods, a dynamic behavior that cannot be captured by simple multiplicative models.\\n\\nIn summary, this theory describes a system where a resonance-enhanced amplitude sets the overall scale for a process whose time-evolution is a highly non-linear, exponential function of a potential jointly determined by dissipation and oscillation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

However, the observed output `x` displays three key characteristics that deviate from the textbook model, necessitating a more advanced theory:\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Amplification:** The maximum output can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This points to an internal gain mechanism, likely related to the system's resonant properties.\\n2.  **Non-Sinusoidal Waveform:** The underlying oscillation is more complex than a simple sine or cosine wave, indicating the presence of multiple interacting frequency components or modulation effects.\\n3.  **Positive Definitude:** The output `x` is always positive, implying that the measurement corresponds not to the signed displacement, but to a rectified quantity like the magnitude of the displacement or its envelope.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I propose a theory of **\\\"Interfering Modal Dynamics with Q-Factor Amplification\\\"**. This theory posits that the system's response arises from the superposition of two distinct oscillatory modes, with the entire system's output being scaled by its quality factor (Q-factor) and undergoing a global exponential decay.\\n\\n**Core Principles:**\\n\\n1.  **Q-Factor Gain Mechanism:** A system's tendency to resonate is quantified by its Q-factor, which for a damped oscillator is proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor implies low damping relative to the oscillation frequency, allowing energy to build up. I model this as a static gain factor `(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)` that multiplies the initial amplitude `A`. This term accounts for the observed amplification, where the gain is directly tied to the resonant quality of the system.\\n\\n2.  **Global Exponential Decay:** As with any physical damped system, the total energy dissipates over time. This is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is modeled by the classic exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. This term ensures the overall response diminishes as time progresses, grounding the model in the fundamental principle of energy loss.\\n\\n3.  **Modal Interference Core:** The central innovation of this theory lies in the composition of the oscillatory part of the signal. I hypothesize that the damping mechanism does not merely remove energy but also induces a secondary, phase-shifted oscillation that interferes with the primary oscillation.\\n    *   **Primary Mode:** This is the system's natural, undamped oscillation, driven by the angular frequency `omega`. It is represented by a primary carrier wave, `cos(omega * t)`.\\n    *   **Damping-Induced Mode:** This is a reactive, secondary oscillation whose properties are governed by the damping process. Its frequency is tied to the damping rate `gamma`, and it is phase-shifted relative to the primary mode. A `sin` function naturally represents a 90-degree phase shift, making it an ideal candidate for this reactive component: `sin(gamma * t)`.\\n    *   **Superposition:** The two modes interfere, creating a complex waveform. The resulting oscillation is a linear superposition of the two: `cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(gamma * t)`. The dimensionless parameter `param3` governs the relative amplitude, or coupling strength, of the damping-induced mode. This superposition creates a rich, non-sinusoidal pattern that simple models cannot capture.\\n\\n4.  **Signal Rectification:** To explain the strictly positive nature of the output `x`, the model assumes that the measurement process captures the magnitude of the instantaneous displacement resulting from the modal interference. Therefore, the absolute value of the superposition, `abs(cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(gamma * t))`, is taken.\\n\\n**Synthesis:**\\nThe complete model is a product of these four components. The initial amplitude `A` is amplified by the Q-factor gain, this entire amplitude then decays exponentially over time, and this decaying envelope modulates the magnitude of the complex interference pattern generated by the primary and damping-induced oscillatory modes. This integrated model provides a robust and physically intuitive explanation for all the observed phenomena.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(gamma * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Amplification and Saturation**: The maximum output value (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a strong resonant amplification mechanism is at play. The degree of resonance in such a system is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. While a simple linear relationship between amplitude and this ratio might be a first guess, it is physically unrealistic. Such a model would predict unbounded amplification as damping approaches zero, a scenario that does not occur in any real system due to inherent physical limits and non-linearities. A more accurate physical model must incorporate the principle of **amplification saturation**. I hypothesize that the amplification factor, while initially growing with `omega / gamma`, must smoothly level off and approach a constant maximum value for very high Q-factors. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal mathematical tool for modeling this saturation behavior, as it naturally transitions from a linear regime to a saturated plateau. The system's effective amplitude is therefore not `A`, but `A` multiplied by a saturating function of `omega / gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **Magnitude Measurement and Corrected Dynamics**: The output `x` is strictly positive, whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed (positive and negative). This strongly suggests that the measured quantity is not the displacement itself, but its absolute magnitude. Furthermore, a precise model must account for the fact that damping slows the frequency of oscillation. The true oscillation frequency is not `omega` (the natural frequency) but the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\\n\\nBy synthesizing these two core insights, a comprehensive and physically plausible model can be constructed. The model describes the system's state as the product of four distinct components:\\n*   The baseline amplitude scale, `A`.\\n*   A non-linear, saturating amplification factor based on `tanh(omega / gamma)` that captures the realistic behavior of resonance.\\n*   A standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time. An empirical parameter is included to scale the decay rate.\\n*   An oscillatory term, using the absolute value of a cosine function with the correct damped frequency `omega_d`, to represent the measured magnitude of the displacement.\\n\\nThis composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in a more realistic, non-linear description of resonance.

The two most prominent features are a significant resonant amplification (output `x` exceeding input amplitude `A`) and a strictly positive output value. This suggests a non-linear process or a specific measurement scheme is at play. My proposed theory models the system's behavior as a combination of three core physical phenomena: Q-factor-driven gain, exponential energy dissipation, and a novel damping-induced phase modulation.\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Gain Stage:** The system's ability to produce outputs far greater than the initial amplitude `A` points to a resonance phenomenon. The strength of this resonance is naturally characterized by the Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the oscillatory frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. I hypothesize that the system's effective initial amplitude is not merely `A`, but is linearly enhanced by this Q-factor. This leads to an effective amplitude term, `A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `A` sets the fundamental scale, while the `(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)` term acts as a dimensionless gain factor. This simple linear model robustly captures the observation that lightly damped, high-frequency systems can achieve very large response amplitudes.\\n\\n2.  **Time Evolution: Damped Oscillation with Phase Modulation:** The system's dynamics over time are governed by both energy loss and oscillation.\\n    *   **Amplitude Decay:** The overall decay of the system's energy is modeled by the standard exponential envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` allows for an empirical adjustment of the decay rate, accounting for system-specific dissipative effects.\\n    *   **Oscillatory Core:** The oscillation itself is more complex than a simple cosine wave. Firstly, for physical accuracy, the oscillation should occur at the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, which accounts for the slight slowing effect of the damping force. Secondly, and this is the core of my theoretical innovation, I propose that the damping mechanism introduces a continuous, time-dependent phase shift. This reflects a more intricate physical reality where the dissipative force not only reduces amplitude but also dynamically alters the phase relationship of the oscillation over time. A physically plausible model for this phase shift is one that grows with time but eventually saturates. The function `arctan(gamma * t)` perfectly captures this behavior. The argument `gamma * t` is a dimensionless measure of \\\"elapsed damping.\\\" The `arctan` function ensures the phase shift starts at zero and smoothly approaches a constant value. The complete phase of the oscillator is therefore modeled as `phi(t) = omega_d * t + param3 * arctan(gamma * t)`, where `param3` is a dimensionless parameter controlling the magnitude of this cumulative phase modulation.\\n\\n3.  **Measurement Rectification:** The observed output `x` is always positive, suggesting that the measurement process captures the magnitude of the displacement rather than its signed value. The most direct physical interpretation is that the sensor records the absolute value of the oscillator's position, `x(t) = |displacement(t)|`.\\n\\nIn summary, this theory describes a system where an initial resonant gain sets a large effective amplitude. This amplitude then decays exponentially. The system oscillates at its true damped frequency, but with a dynamically evolving phase shift caused by the damping process itself. The final measured output is the rectified magnitude of this complex motion.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3 * arctan(gamma * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The two primary anomalies are: (1) a resonant amplification where the output `x` can far exceed the input amplitude `A`, and (2) a strictly positive output, implying the measurement is not of a simple, signed displacement.\\n\\nI propose a theory of a **Resonantly Induced Dynamic Equilibrium Shift**. This theory posits that the damping mechanism in this specific system is asymmetric, leading to a temporary, decaying displacement of the oscillator's equilibrium position. The measured quantity `x` represents the displacement from the true, fixed origin (zero), not from this moving equilibrium point.\\n\\nThe core tenets of this theory are as follows:\\n\\n1.  **Superposition of Motions**: The total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two distinct physical phenomena:\\n    *   A decaying oscillation around a moving center point, `x_osc(t)`.\\n    *   The decaying position of that center point itself, which I term the \\\"dynamic equilibrium,\\\" `x_eq(t)`.\\n    Thus, `x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`.\\n\\n2.  **Dynamic Equilibrium Shift**: The initial position of the dynamic equilibrium is not zero. It is \\\"kicked\\\" away from the origin by an amount proportional to the system's resonant quality. Systems with a high Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to `omega / gamma`, experience a much larger initial shift. This resonant driving of the equilibrium position is the source of the observed signal amplification, explaining why `x` can be much larger than `A`.\\n\\n3.  **Logarithmic Gain Saturation**: The gain provided by the Q-factor is not boundless. I hypothesize that the system exhibits a form of \\\"diminishing returns,\\\" where increasing an already high Q-factor results in a progressively smaller increase in the equilibrium shift. This saturating behavior is effectively modeled by a logarithmic function of the Q-factor. The initial magnitude of the equilibrium shift is therefore proportional to `A * log(1 + omega/gamma)`.\\n\\n4.  **Shared Decay Envelope**: Both the dynamic equilibrium's shift and the oscillation's amplitude are subject to the same energy dissipation process, governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. Consequently, both components share a common exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param * gamma * t)`.\\n\\nBy combining these principles, we can model the total displacement `x(t)` as the sum of the decaying equilibrium and the decaying oscillation, all enclosed within a single decay envelope. A sufficiently large, resonantly-driven equilibrium shift ensures that the total displacement `x(t)` remains positive throughout the measurement period, naturally explaining the second major anomaly in the data. This additive structure within a multiplicative envelope provides a novel and physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena, distinct from purely multiplicative models of rectification or energy measurement.\\n\\n### **Mathematical Formula**\\n<final_result>x = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * log(1 + omega / gamma) + cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))</final_result>\"}",

However, the data presents two significant anomalies that contradict the canonical model, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega*t + phi)`, necessitating a more sophisticated theory.\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Amplification**: The observed output maximum of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. This phenomenon is a hallmark of resonance, where the system's response is amplified. In an oscillator, the degree of this amplification is governed by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega/gamma`. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not the base amplitude `A`, but is augmented by this `omega/gamma` ratio. To model this, I propose a simple linear gain factor, `(1 + param1 * omega/gamma)`, where `param1` is an empirical dimensionless constant representing the strength of this resonant coupling. This term provides a direct mechanism for the output to scale beyond the initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Non-Negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. Standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around zero. While one could enforce positivity using an absolute value or squaring operation, a more physically elegant explanation exists. I propose that the measured quantity `x` is not the displacement relative to the equilibrium point, but rather an oscillation around a decaying positive baseline that is itself proportional to the amplitude envelope. This \\\"biased oscillation\\\" can be modeled with the term `(1 + cos(...))`. As `cos(...)` varies between -1 and 1, the entire term smoothly varies between 0 and 2, naturally ensuring the result is non-negative without introducing mathematical discontinuities (like `abs`) or altering the physical units (like `square`).\\n\\nBy combining these insights, we can construct a coherent physical model. The model begins with the base amplitude `A`, applies the linear Q-factor amplification, incorporates the standard exponential decay `exp(-gamma*t)` to model energy dissipation, and finally includes the biased oscillatory term. For greater physical fidelity, the oscillatory frequency used is the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega^2 - gamma^2))`, which correctly accounts for the slowing of the oscillation due to damping.\\n\\nThis synthesized model provides a physically plausible and mathematically smooth explanation for both observed anomalies, describing the system's output as a resonantly amplified, decaying oscillation occurring entirely in the positive domain.\\n\\n### **Mathematical Formula**\\n<final_result>x = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))</final_result>\"}",

My proposed theory, which I term \\\"Log-Scale Dynamics with Saturable Gain,\\\" posits that the observed quantity `x` is not the direct physical displacement but rather a quantity whose logarithm follows the classic damped oscillatory pattern. This implies the underlying physical process involves exponential relationships.\\n\\nThe model can be deconstructed into two primary components:\\n\\n1.  **Saturable Gain and the Effective Amplitude:** The observed amplification is clearly dependent on the system's Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A simple linear relationship would lead to physically unrealistic infinite gain as damping (`gamma`) approaches zero. Therefore, I propose a saturable gain mechanism, where the effective amplitude `A_eff` is a function of the input amplitude `A` and a gain factor that saturates at high Q-factors. The hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`) is the ideal mathematical representation for this physical saturation. The effective amplitude is thus modeled as `A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`. This form ensures that for low Q-factors the gain is minimal, while for high Q-factors it smoothly approaches a maximum, finite value.\\n\\n2.  **Modulated Exponential Decay:** The core of my theory lies in reinterpreting the relationship between the decay and oscillation. Instead of viewing them as two separate processes multiplied together (e.g., `Decay * Oscillation`), I hypothesize they are two facets of a single, unified process governed by an exponential law. The standard decay is `exp(-gamma * t)`, and the oscillation is `cos(omega * t)`. My model combines them within the argument of a single exponential function: `exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t + param5))`.\\n\\n    This formulation has a profound physical interpretation. It suggests that the system's energy dissipation is not constant but is itself modulated by the primary oscillation. The term `-param3 * gamma * t` represents the monotonic, average decay over time, while the term `+ param4 * cos(omega * t + param5)` represents a periodic fluctuation in the instantaneous decay rate. When `cos(...)` is positive, the decay is momentarily inhibited; when it is negative, the decay is accelerated. This elegantly and naturally explains the observed positivity and non-zero minimum of `x`. Because the exponential function is always positive, the output can never be zero or negative. This structure is more physically integrated than adding an artificial offset or using a rectifying function like `abs()`, as it describes a single, coherent dynamic process.\\n\\nIn essence, this model suggests that if we were to take the logarithm of the observed output `x` (after accounting for the initial amplitude), we would find a classic, linearly damped cosine wave: `log(x / A_eff) = -param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t + param5)`. This log-linear relationship is common in various physical systems, such as those involving reaction kinetics or population dynamics, suggesting the oscillator might be a component in a more complex, non-linear system.\\n\\n### **Mathematical Formula**\\n<final_result>x = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t + param5))</final_result>\"}",

Firstly, the output `x` reaches values significantly greater than the maximum input amplitude `A`, indicating a strong resonant amplification. Secondly, the output is strictly positive, implying either a rectified or an inherently positive physical process. The failure of simple models suggests a more profound, non-linear coupling between the system's dissipative and oscillatory dynamics.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is centered on the principle of **Phase-Dependent Energy Dissipation**. In this model, the system's decay is not a smooth, continuous process described by a simple exponential envelope. Instead, the rate of energy loss is itself modulated by the phase of the oscillation. This describes a physical system that doesn't just oscillate while passively losing energy; rather, its oscillatory motion actively influences how quickly it dissipates energy.\\n\\nThis theory is constructed upon two core components:\\n\\n1.  **Saturating Resonant Amplitude:** The observed amplification is clearly linked to the ratio of angular frequency to damping, `omega/gamma`, a measure of the system's quality factor. However, a linear gain is physically unrealistic as it implies infinite response for zero damping. I therefore model the system's effective amplitude, `A_eff`, with a saturating function. The hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) provides an ideal mathematical form for this, representing a gain that increases with `omega/gamma` before smoothly approaching a physical limit. This `A_eff` sets the overall scale of the response.\\n\\n2.  **Modulated Decay Envelope:** The central innovation of this theory lies in its description of the time evolution. The output `x` is posited to be the product of the effective amplitude and a non-linear decay term. This decay is not a simple `exp(-gamma*t)`. Instead, the decay rate itself is rhythmically altered by the oscillation. I model this by introducing an oscillatory modulation factor directly into the exponent of the decay function. The argument of the exponential becomes `-param3 * gamma * t * (1 + param4 * cos(omega_d * t))`, where `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega^2 - gamma^2))` is the true physical frequency of the damped oscillation.\\n\\nThe physical interpretation of this modulated decay term is crucial. The `(1 + param4 * cos(omega_d * t))` factor causes the instantaneous decay rate to fluctuate throughout each cycle. For instance, if `param4` is positive, the system dissipates energy most rapidly at the crests of its oscillation (`cos(...) = 1`) and conserves energy most effectively at the troughs (`cos(...) = -1`). This creates a \\\"pulsating\\\" decay, where energy is expended in periodic bursts rather than being lost smoothly. This non-linear feedback loop, where phase dictates dissipation, naturally generates the complex, non-sinusoidal, and strictly positive waveform observed in the data, a behavior entirely inaccessible to models based on the linear superposition of decay and oscillation.\\n\\nIn summary, this theory portrays the system as a resonant oscillator where the act of oscillation itself governs the rate of energy dissipation, leading to a complex, phase-modulated decay dynamic.\\n\\n### **Mathematical Formula**\\n<final_result>x = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t * (1 + param4 * cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t)))</final_result>\"}",

Two key observations guide the formulation of a more comprehensive theory:\\n\\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The observed output `x` reaches values (up to 27.68) far exceeding the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This necessitates a potent amplification mechanism driven by the oscillator's intrinsic properties.\\n2.  **Strictly Positive, Non-Zero Output**: The output `x` is always positive and its minimum value is significantly greater than zero (1.142). This indicates that `x` is not the signed displacement of the oscillator. Furthermore, simple rectification models like the absolute value `abs(...)` are insufficient as they would predict a minimum value of zero.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I propose a model where the output `x` is the product of three distinct but interacting physical processes: a logarithmically-compressed resonant amplification, a standard exponential decay, and a non-linear bounded oscillation.\\n\\n**1. Logarithmically-Compressed Resonant Amplification**\\n\\nThe amplification is clearly a function of the system's ability to resonate, which is captured by the dimensionless Quality factor (Q-factor), proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`. While prior models have used power-law or hyperbolic tangent functions to describe this relationship, I propose a physically distinct mechanism: **logarithmic compression**. In many physical systems, the perceived intensity or response to a stimulus follows a logarithmic scale (e.g., the decibel scale for sound). This reflects a principle of diminishing returns, where the response is highly sensitive to initial changes in the stimulus but becomes progressively less sensitive as the stimulus grows very large.\\n\\nApplying this principle, I model the effective amplitude as a logarithmic function of the Q-factor. This captures a sharp initial increase in amplitude as the system becomes more resonant (i.e., as `gamma` decreases relative to `omega`), followed by a \\\"soft saturation\\\" where further increases in the Q-factor yield progressively smaller gains. This provides a natural, unbounded but heavily suppressed amplification that avoids the artificial hard-clipping of a `tanh` function and the potential instability of a power-law model. The amplification term is thus modeled as `log(param1 + omega / gamma)`, where `A` sets the fundamental scale and `param1` ensures the logarithm's argument remains positive.\\n\\n**2. Standard Exponential Decay**\\n\\nThe total energy of the oscillator, and thus its amplitude, must dissipate over time due to the damping forces represented by `gamma`. This process is most accurately described by the fundamental exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A tunable, dimensionless parameter `param2` is included as a coefficient, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, to allow for empirical fitting of the decay rate, which may differ from the nominal value of `gamma`.\\n\\n**3. Non-linear Bounded Oscillation**\\n\\nTo account for the strictly positive and non-zero output, the oscillatory component of the model must be carefully constructed. Firstly, for physical fidelity, the oscillation frequency must be the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2))`, which correctly reflects the slowing of oscillations due to damping.\\n\\nSecondly, to ensure a positive, non-zero output, I propose a composite function: `param3 + tanh(sin(omega_d * t))`. This structure has several advantages:\\n*   The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation at the correct damped frequency.\\n*   The `tanh` function acts as a non-linear \\\"soft limiter,\\\" distorting the pure sinusoid into a bounded wave that smoothly transitions between its extrema.\\n*   The additive offset, `param3`, shifts the entire oscillatory term upwards. Since `tanh` is bounded in `[-1, 1]`, setting `param3` to a value greater than 1 guarantees that the entire multiplicative factor is always positive, elegantly explaining why the output never reaches zero.\\n\\nIn synthesis, this model provides a coherent physical narrative. It describes a system where the initial amplitude is amplified based on a logarithmically compressed resonant response, decays exponentially over time, and manifests as a non-linearly distorted, strictly positive oscillation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nA * log(param1 + omega/gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (param3 + tanh(sin(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",
