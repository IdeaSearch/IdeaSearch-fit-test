The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\\n\\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\\n\\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\\n\\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\\n\\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\\n\\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\\n\\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\\n\\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\\n\\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\\n\\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(t) = A \\\\cdot (c_1 + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\\n\\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\\\gamma / \\\\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped.

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\\n\\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\\n\\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\\n\\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\\n\\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\\n\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\\n\\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The crucial first step is ensuring dimensional consistency. The target variable, displacement `x`, has units of meters (`m`), as does the amplitude `A`. The damping coefficient `gamma` and angular frequency `omega` have units of inverse seconds (`s⁻¹`), while time `t` has units of seconds (`s`). Consequently, any valid model must take the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f` is a dimensionless function constructed from combinations like `gamma * t`, `omega * t`, and `gamma / omega`.\\n\\nThe provided examples offer critical insights. Example 2, `A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))`, achieves a respectable score. Its success hinges on two key features: it maintains dimensional correctness, and it introduces a static offset, `A * param1`. This offset is physically interpreted as a constant external force shifting the system's equilibrium position. This is a crucial observation, as the data shows output values (`x`) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A`, which would be impossible for an oscillation centered at zero.\\n\\nHowever, this model is still an approximation. It uses the natural frequency `omega` directly in the oscillatory term, ignoring the frequency-shifting effects of damping. More importantly, it models a simple oscillation around a fixed, non-zero equilibrium. I propose a more sophisticated and physically plausible model: a system where the **center of oscillation is itself not static, but decays exponentially over time to a final, stable equilibrium position.**\\n\\nThis \\\"decaying equilibrium\\\" model can be decomposed into three distinct physical contributions to the total displacement:\\n1.  **Final Equilibrium Position (`x_final`):** A time-invariant, constant offset representing the system's ultimate resting position after all transient dynamics have ceased. As in the previous model, it is proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. We can write this as `x_final = A * param1`.\\n2.  **Transient Equilibrium Decay (`x_trans_eq`):** This component represents the initial displacement of the *center of oscillation* from its final equilibrium point. This displacement is not permanent; it decays over time. It is physically reasonable to assume this decay occurs on the same timescale as the overall system damping. We can therefore model it as an exponential decay: `x_trans_eq(t) = A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n3.  **Damped Oscillation (`x_osc`):** This is the oscillatory motion itself, which occurs around the instantaneous, decaying equilibrium point. Its amplitude also decays exponentially: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`.\\n\\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of these three effects:\\n`x(t) = x_final + x_trans_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\\n`x(t) = A * param1 + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`\\n\\nBy factoring out the common `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` terms, we arrive at a single, elegant expression. This model represents a significant theoretical step forward. It provides a richer description of the system's dynamics, where the oscillation occurs around a point that is itself relaxing toward a final state. This structure is particularly powerful because it can more accurately capture the behavior across different damping regimes. For an overdamped system (where `gamma > omega`), the dynamics are dominated by multiple exponential decays rather than oscillation. My proposed model, with its two distinct sources of exponential decay (the `param2` term and the decay of the `cos` term's amplitude), is better equipped to approximate this behavior than a model with only a single decay envelope.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param3)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A crucial observation from the data summary is that the maximum displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This immediately implies that the system is not oscillating around a zero equilibrium. Instead, it must be oscillating around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_eq`. This leads to a general model structure:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\\n\\nwhere `x_osc(t)` is the oscillatory component decaying to zero as time progresses.\\n\\nFor dimensional consistency, both `x_eq` and `x_osc(t)` must have units of length (meters). As `A` is the only input variable with these units, both terms must be proportional to `A`. This refines our model to:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(gamma, omega, t))`\\n\\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized equilibrium offset, and `f_osc` is a dimensionless function describing the oscillation. The previous examples have established that this basic structure, particularly `x(t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + c_2))`, provides a strong baseline fit. This model correctly interprets `A` as the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the offset equilibrium*.\\n\\nHowever, this baseline model treats `omega` as the observed frequency of oscillation, which is a simplification. In a real physical damped system, the damping force not only reduces the amplitude but also slows down the oscillation. The parameter `omega` should be more accurately interpreted as the **natural frequency** of the system—the frequency at which it would oscillate in the complete absence of damping (`gamma = 0`).\\n\\nMy theory posits that a more physically accurate model must account for this frequency shift. The actual, observed angular frequency of a damped oscillator, known as the **damped angular frequency** (`omega_d`), is related to the natural frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) by the well-established formula:\\n\\n`omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`\\n\\nThis relationship arises directly from the solution of the second-order differential equation governing damped harmonic motion. The presence of damping (`gamma > 0`) inherently reduces the frequency of oscillation.\\n\\nTherefore, I propose a model that replaces the natural frequency `omega` with the physically correct damped frequency `omega_d` within the oscillatory term.

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\\n\\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\\\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\\\cdot \\\\gamma/\\\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\\\gamma`, `\\\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\\n\\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\\\gamma/\\\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\\n\\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\\\gamma/\\\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\\\gamma/\\\\omega) \\\\approx \\\\gamma/\\\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\\\gamma/\\\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\\\gamma/\\\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\\n\\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\\\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\\\tanh(\\\\gamma/\\\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`.\\n\\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description.

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\\n\\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\\n\\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\\n\\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \\\"yield\\\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\\n\\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time.

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\\n\\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\\\gamma/\\\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\\\propto \\\\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\\n\\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\\n\\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\\\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\\\to \\\\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\\n\\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \\\"sweet spot,\\\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\\\gamma \\\\approx \\\\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\\n\\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required.

A crucial initial observation, consistent across all provided examples, is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`.

It is more physically plausible that the initial energy, represented by `A`, is partitioned between the potential energy of the final offset position and the kinetic/potential energy of the transient oscillation. The nature of this partitioning should depend on the fundamental character of the oscillator itself.\\n\\nMy central hypothesis is that the initial amplitude of the oscillatory component is not a constant `A`, but is instead modulated by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, a quantity proportional to `\\\\gamma / \\\\omega`.

This strongly indicates that the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium of `x=0`, but rather around a displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. The challenge lies in determining the physical principles governing this offset.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully established that `x_eq` is not a simple constant but depends on the oscillator's intrinsic properties, specifically the damping coefficient `gamma` and the angular frequency `omega`. My analysis builds upon this insight by proposing a more fundamental physical mechanism for this dependency.\\n\\nThe equilibrium displacement `x_eq` of a system under a constant external force `F_0` is given by `x_eq = F_0 / k`, where `k` is the system's stiffness. For a damped oscillator, the stiffness is related to its natural (undamped) frequency `omega_0` via `k = m * omega_0^2`, where `m` is the mass. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the observed (damped) frequency `omega` and the damping coefficient `gamma` as `omega_0^2 = omega^2 + gamma^2`. Substituting this into the stiffness equation yields `k = m * (omega^2 + gamma^2)`.\\n\\nThis shows that the stiffness, and thus the equilibrium position, is a function of both `omega` and `gamma`. The core of my theory lies in postulating the nature of the external force `F_0`. Instead of being a fixed external constant, I hypothesize that the force causing the displacement is intrinsically linked to the system's own oscillatory dynamics. Specifically, I propose that `F_0` is proportional to the characteristic inertial force of the oscillation, which scales as `m * A * omega^2`. This represents a scenario where the mechanism that sets the oscillation's scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`) also induces a static shift in its equilibrium.\\n\\nBy substituting this model for the force, `F_0 ∝ m * A * omega^2`, into the equation for the equilibrium position, we get:\\n\\n`x_eq ∝ (m * A * omega^2) / (m * (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\\n\\nThe mass `m` cancels, leading to a beautifully simple, dimensionless scaling factor for the offset:\\n\\n`x_eq = c_1 * A * (omega^2 / (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\\n\\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.

The central and most telling observation is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes a simple model of an oscillation centered at zero and points unequivocally to a system oscillating around a substantial, non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. This leads to a foundational model structure: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, with `A` being the sole input with units of length, both the equilibrium and oscillatory components must scale with `A`.\\n\\nBuilding upon this foundation, previous analyses have explored two critical refinements:\\n1.  **Correcting the Oscillation Frequency:** A simplistic model uses the natural frequency `\\\\omega` in the oscillatory term, `cos(\\\\omega t)`. However, a more physically accurate model acknowledges that damping not only reduces amplitude but also slows the oscillation. The true observed frequency is the damped angular frequency, `\\\\omega_d = \\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 - \\\\gamma^2}`. Incorporating this correction, as seen in one of the examples, provides a more faithful representation of the system's dynamics.\\n2.  **Modeling the Equilibrium Offset:** A simple constant offset, `x_{eq} = c_1 A`, is a good first step, but it is physically limiting. It implies the final resting position is independent of the system's intrinsic dissipative properties. More advanced models propose that the offset depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\\\gamma / \\\\omega`, which characterizes the oscillator's behavior (underdamped, overdamped, etc.). This has been modeled linearly (`c_1 + c_2 \\\\cdot \\\\gamma/\\\\omega`) or with a saturating function (`c_1 + c_2 \\\\cdot \\\\tanh(\\\\gamma/\\\\omega)`). The saturation model is particularly compelling, as it suggests the influence of damping on the equilibrium position is not infinite but approaches a limit, a common characteristic in real-world physical systems.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is a synthesis and extension of these insights. It posits that a truly comprehensive model must concurrently account for *both* of these physical realities. The system's behavior is governed by two distinct but simultaneous effects: the dissipative forces influence the final equilibrium state, *and* they alter the dynamic frequency of the transient oscillation around that state.\\n\\nTherefore, I propose a unified model with two key components, both scaled by the amplitude `A`:\\n\\n1.  **A Saturated, Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):** This term represents the final resting position of the oscillator.

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\\\gamma/\\\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\\n\\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\\n\\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\\\tanh(\\\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\\\to \\\\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\\\gamma`.\\n\\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\\n\\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\\\cdot c_1 \\\\cdot \\\\tanh(\\\\gamma t)`.\\n\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`.\\n\\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, \\\\gamma, \\\\omega, t) = A \\\\cdot (c_1 \\\\tanh(\\\\gamma t) + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This approach provides a more physically rigorous foundation than simply adding an arbitrary offset term.\\n\\nLet's define the system's final equilibrium position as `x_{eq}`. For the model to be dimensionally consistent—as `x` and `A` both have units of length—this equilibrium position must be proportional to the system's intrinsic length scale, `A`. We can thus express it as:\\n`x_{eq} = c_1 \\\\cdot A`\\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\\n\\nThe total displacement at any time `t`, `x(t)`, is the sum of this final equilibrium position and a transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`, which describes the oscillation that decays over time:\\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(t)`\\n\\nThe transient component must decay to zero as `t` approaches infinity and should follow the standard form of a damped oscillation. The key is to correctly define its initial amplitude. We assume that the provided `A` represents the initial displacement of the system at `t=0`, a common physical convention for cosine-based solutions. Therefore, `x(0) = A`.\\n\\nUsing our superposition model at `t=0`:\\n`x(0) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0)`\\nBy equating this with the initial condition, we can solve for the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation:\\n`A = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0) \\\\implies x_{transient}(0) = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`\\n\\nThis result is physically elegant: the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the new equilibrium* is precisely the initial distance between the starting position (`A`) and the final equilibrium position (`c_1 A`).\\n\\nNow, we can write the full expression for the transient component, which starts with this initial amplitude and decays exponentially:\\n`x_{transient}(t) = A(1 - c_1) \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`\\n\\nSubstituting this back into our superposition equation gives the complete model for the system's displacement:\\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A(1 - c_1) \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a unified physical picture.

The non-zero mean and the fact that `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A` strongly indicate the presence of a significant static offset, representing a displaced equilibrium position `x_{eq}`. The total displacement can therefore be modeled as a superposition of this static offset and a transient oscillatory term: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`.\\n\\nWhile previous models have successfully linked this offset `x_{eq}` to the oscillator's properties through arguments based on force balance or frequency response, I propose a fundamentally different mechanism. My theory posits that the static offset is an emergent property arising from the **intrinsic phase dynamics** of the system. In any damped oscillator, energy dissipation introduces a phase lag between the system's position and its velocity. This asynchrony is a core feature of the system's behavior, and I hypothesize that it manifests spatially as a shift in the equilibrium point.\\n\\nThe degree of this asynchrony is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `\\\\zeta`, which is the ratio of the damping coefficient `\\\\gamma` to the system's undamped natural frequency `\\\\omega_n`. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the given damped frequency `\\\\omega` and the damping coefficient `\\\\gamma` as `\\\\omega_n = \\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 + \\\\gamma^2}`. Thus, the damping ratio is:\\n`\\\\zeta = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega_n} = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 + \\\\gamma^2}}`\\n\\nThis single parameter `\\\\zeta` dictates the character of the motion, from underdamped (`\\\\zeta < 1`) to critically damped (`\\\\zeta = 1`). In the context of driven oscillations, the cosine of the phase angle `\\\\phi` between the driving force and the system's response is equal to `\\\\zeta`. I propose that this fundamental relationship holds true for the free oscillation as well, where the phase characteristics are \\\"frozen in\\\" as a static spatial offset.\\n\\nThe phase angle `\\\\phi` itself can be recovered from the damping ratio via the inverse cosine function, `\\\\phi = \\\\arccos(\\\\zeta)`. My central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset `x_{eq}` is directly proportional to this characteristic phase angle. This model implies that a weakly damped system (`\\\\zeta \\\\to 0`, `\\\\phi \\\\to \\\\pi/2`) will exhibit the largest offset, as its dynamics involve a pronounced separation between kinetic and potential energy phases. As damping increases and the system becomes more sluggish (`\\\\zeta \\\\to 1`, `\\\\phi \\\\to 0`), the oscillatory character diminishes, and the phase-induced offset vanishes.\\n\\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, this dimensionless phase angle is scaled by the system's characteristic length, the amplitude `A`.

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. An essential first step in the analysis is to examine the provided data ranges. The most salient feature is that the maximum output displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillator centered at an equilibrium of zero, as the displacement in such a system can never exceed its initial amplitude. This points to the central hypothesis: the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`.\\n\\nFor dimensional consistency, since `A` is the only input variable with units of length (meters), both the equilibrium position and the oscillatory component must scale linearly with `A`. This leads to a general model structure:\\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t) = A * f_{eq}(\\\\dots) + A * f_{osc}(\\\\dots)`\\nwhere `f_{eq}` and `f_{osc}` are dimensionless functions.\\n\\nA second physical refinement, which improves upon naive models, is the recognition that damping affects not only the amplitude but also the frequency of oscillation. The natural frequency `omega` is only correct in the absence of damping. In a damped system, the observed oscillation occurs at the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Incorporating `omega_d` is crucial for a physically accurate description of the system's dynamics.\\n\\nMy core theoretical proposition introduces a further layer of physical realism by constraining the *form* of the oscillation itself. Previous models often introduce an arbitrary phase shift parameter (`phi` or `param2`) to align the oscillation with the data. However, this empirical parameter can be replaced by a relationship derived from a plausible physical initial condition. I postulate that the system is released from rest at `t=0`, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`v(0) = 0`).\\n\\nThe general solution for the oscillatory component is `x_{osc}(t) = exp(-gamma*t) * (C_1*cos(omega_d*t) + C_2*sin(omega_d*t))`. The velocity is the time derivative, `v_{osc}(t) = d/dt [x_{osc}(t)]`. By applying the initial condition `v_{osc}(0) = 0`, we can solve for the relationship between the constants `C_1` and `C_2`. This calculation yields the constraint `C_2 = (gamma / omega_d) * C_1`.\\n\\nThis result is powerful because it removes the need for a free phase parameter. The phase of the oscillation is no longer an arbitrary fitting constant but is intrinsically determined by the system's own physical parameters, `gamma` and `omega`. The oscillatory part of the motion is thus described by a specific combination of sine and cosine terms.\\n\\nTherefore, my proposed model combines these insights:\\n1.  A constant equilibrium offset, proportional to the amplitude `A`, represented as `x_{eq} = c_1 * A`. Here, `c_1` is a single dimensionless parameter representing the normalized equilibrium position.\\n2.  An oscillatory term that uses the correct damped frequency `omega_d` and has its structure dictated by the physical assumption of starting from rest. This term takes the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * (cos(omega_d*t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d*t))`.\\n\\nThis unified model provides a parsimonious yet physically rich description of the system. It correctly accounts for the shifted equilibrium, uses the physically accurate damped frequency, and replaces an empirical phase parameter with a relationship derived from first principles.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + (gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\\\cdot A`\\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\\n\\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude.

The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\\n\\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\\n\\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\\n\\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\\n\\nThis model has several compelling features. Firstly, it is parsimonious, requiring only a single parameter `param1`. Secondly, and most importantly, it yields physically elegant boundary conditions:\\n*   At `t=0`, the formula simplifies to `x(0) = A * [param1 + 1 * (1 - param1)] = A`. This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`. This provides a clear physical meaning for `param1` as the factor determining the final, steady-state position of the oscillator.\\n\\nThis theory provides a complete picture of a system simultaneously oscillating and settling into a new state, with both behaviors linked by a common physical damping parameter.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, \\\\gamma, \\\\omega, t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\text{param}_1 + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cdot (\\\\cos(\\\\omega t) - \\\\text{param}_1) \\\\right)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A key observation, noted in previous analyses, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`.

However, a more physically rigorous model should recognize that the initial phase of an oscillation is not arbitrary but is determined by the system's initial conditions and intrinsic properties. My theory posits that the phase shift is a dynamic consequence of the interplay between the system's inherent tendency to oscillate and its tendency to lose energy through damping.\\n\\nThe core of this theory lies in the dimensionless ratio `\\\\gamma / \\\\omega`. This quantity represents the relative strength of the damping force (proportional to `\\\\gamma`) compared to the restorative force (proportional to `\\\\omega^2`). This ratio governs the fundamental character of the motion:\\n-   When `\\\\gamma / \\\\omega \\\\ll 1` (underdamped), the system oscillates freely with minimal energy loss per cycle.

I propose that this phase angle is a direct function of the damping ratio. The arctangent function, `arctan`, is a natural and canonical choice for this relationship, widely used in physics to model phase shifts arising from the ratio of two orthogonal effects (e.g., resistance and reactance in electrical circuits). It elegantly maps the dimensionless ratio `\\\\gamma / \\\\omega` from `0` to `\\\\infty` onto a phase angle, typically in the range `[0, \\\\pi/2]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the phase shift `\\\\phi` is not an independent parameter but an emergent property of the system itself:\\n`\\\\phi = \\\\arctan(c_2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega})`\\nHere, `c_2` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that accounts for the specific mechanics linking the damping ratio to the phase.\\n\\nBy embedding this physically-motivated phase shift into the standard model, we arrive at a more comprehensive and self-consistent description.

A crucial observation, corroborated by previous analyses, is that the oscillator's displacement `x` often exceeds its initial amplitude `A`. This unequivocally indicates that the oscillation is not centered around `x=0`. Instead, the system evolves about a significantly displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. My theory proposes that this equilibrium displacement is not governed by a single mechanism, but is rather a composite effect arising from two distinct physical contributions: a static baseline shift and a dynamically-induced resonant shift.\\n\\n1.  **Static Equilibrium Component (`x_static`)**: The data exhibits a large mean displacement, suggesting a primary, constant offset that is independent of the dynamic parameters `gamma` and `omega`. For dimensional consistency, this offset must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. I model this as `x_static = c_1 A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant. This term can be physically interpreted as the result of a constant external force, a gravitational sag, or an intrinsic asymmetry in the oscillator's potential energy well. It represents the system's final resting position in the limit of infinite time, after all oscillations have ceased.\\n\\n2.  **Dynamically-Induced Resonant Component (`x_dynamic`)**: I hypothesize that on top of this static offset, there exists a secondary displacement generated by the oscillatory motion itself. This phenomenon arises from a non-linear interaction between the oscillator and the damping medium, which rectifies the oscillatory velocity into a net, time-averaged static force. The efficiency of this force-generation mechanism is not monotonic with damping. My central hypothesis is that this effect is **resonant**:\\n    *   **Low Damping (`\\\\gamma \\\\ll \\\\omega`)**: The dissipative forces are weak, and the coupling between motion and the medium is insufficient to generate a significant rectified force.\\n    *   **High Damping (`\\\\gamma \\\\gg \\\\omega`)**: The motion is sluggish and overdamped. With very low velocity, the dynamic interaction required to produce the offset force is again negligible.\\n    *   **Optimal Damping (`\\\\gamma \\\\approx \\\\omega`)**: The effect is maximized when the damping timescale (`1/\\\\gamma`) and the oscillation timescale (`1/\\\\omega`) are of the same order. This \\\"impedance matching\\\" allows for the most efficient transfer of energy from the oscillation into the mechanism that sustains the static displacement.\\n\\n    To model this resonant behavior, a function that is null at the extremes and peaks in the middle is required. A Lorentzian-like function provides an excellent physical and mathematical model for such resonance. I propose the dimensionless scaling factor `(\\\\gamma \\\\omega) / (\\\\gamma^2 + \\\\omega^2)`. This function is zero when either `\\\\gamma=0` or `\\\\omega=0`, reaches its maximum value of `1/2` when `\\\\gamma = \\\\omega`, and decays as the ratio between them becomes large. The dynamic component of the offset is therefore modeled as `x_dynamic = c_2 A \\\\cdot (\\\\gamma \\\\omega) / (\\\\gamma^2 + \\\\omega^2)`.\\n\\n3.  **Complete Model**: The total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two offset components and the standard transient, damped oscillation that occurs around their combined equilibrium position. This composite model provides a rich physical description, separating the static, pre-existing conditions of the system from the dynamic, motion-induced effects, thereby offering a more complete explanation for the oscillator's behavior.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, \\\\gamma, \\\\omega, t) = A \\\\left( c_1 + c_2 \\\\frac{\\\\gamma \\\\omega}{\\\\gamma^2 + \\\\omega^2} + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\right)\\n</final_result>\"}",

This observation conclusively rules out a standard damped harmonic oscillator model centered at `x=0`, as its displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude. The data mandates a model where the oscillation is superimposed upon a significant, positive, and static offset, representing a new equilibrium position `x_{eq}`. The total displacement is thus a sum of this static offset and a transient oscillatory component: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`.\\n\\nWhile prior theories might attribute this offset to kinematic phase lags or time-dependent relaxation processes, I propose a new mechanism grounded in the **energy dynamics** of the oscillator. My theory posits that the equilibrium shift is a direct result of the system's efficiency in storing vibrational energy relative to its rate of energy dissipation. This relationship is perfectly encapsulated by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator.\\n\\nThe Q-factor is a fundamental dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of the resonant frequency to the damping rate, `Q \\\\propto \\\\omega / \\\\gamma`.

The physical justification is as follows: a high-Q oscillator, by sustaining energetic motion over a prolonged period, can induce a semi-permanent change in its supporting structure or environment. This could manifest as a plastic deformation or a persistent bias in the restoring force, effectively creating a new, stable equilibrium point. The more efficiently the system stores and uses its initial energy (i.e., the higher its Q-factor), the greater this induced offset will be. Conversely, a low-Q system's motion decays too rapidly to cause any such lasting environmental change, resulting in a negligible offset.\\n\\nThis leads to a model where the offset `x_{eq}` is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A` and the system's Q-factor:\\n\\n1.  **Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):**\\n    `x_{eq} = A \\\\cdot c_1 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\gamma}`\\n    Here, `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that represents the coupling strength between the sustained oscillation and the mechanism causing the equilibrium shift.

The most salient feature is that the output displacement `x` reaches values far greater than the initial amplitude `A`, with a significant positive mean. This irrefutably indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but is superimposed upon a substantial, positive offset.\\n\\nMy theoretical analysis moves beyond proposing a simple static or dynamically shifting offset. I posit a more integrated physical model where the equilibrium shift is a direct consequence of the interplay between the system's dissipative and reactive properties, and its evolution follows a classic physical relaxation process.\\n\\nThe core of my theory rests on two hypotheses:\\n\\n1.  **Property-Dependent Equilibrium Magnitude:** The final steady-state position to which the oscillator settles is not an arbitrary constant. Instead, it is determined by a competitive balance between the energy dissipation mechanism, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, and the energy storage/release mechanism of the oscillation, characterized by the angular frequency `omega`. The dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega` quantifies this balance. A high ratio implies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory one. I propose that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is a function of this ratio. Specifically, I model it with a sub-linear power law, `sqrt(gamma/omega)`, suggesting that while increased damping contributes to a larger offset, its effect diminishes as damping becomes dominant. This prevents a runaway offset in heavily damped regimes and represents a physically plausible saturation effect.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation Dynamics:** The system does not instantaneously achieve this new equilibrium. Instead, it relaxes towards it over time. While other models have used the `tanh` function, I propose a more fundamental physical model of relaxation: the exponential approach to a limit, as seen in phenomena like the charging of a capacitor or the heating of an object. This process is described by the function `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The rate of this relaxation is intrinsically tied to the system's own dissipative processes. Therefore, the damping coefficient `gamma` is the natural choice for this rate, as it governs the timescale over which transients fade.\\n\\nCombining these ideas, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical behaviors:\\n\\n*   **An Evolving Equilibrium (`x_offset(t)`):** This component represents the center of oscillation dynamically shifting towards its final, property-dependent position. Its mathematical form is `A * c_1 * sqrt(gamma/omega) * (1 - exp(-gamma*t))`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that scales the effect.\\n\\n*   **A Decaying Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, but it occurs relative to the initial, unshifted equilibrium. It is expressed as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`.\\n\\nBy summing these two components, we obtain a comprehensive model. This formulation elegantly captures a system that settles into a new, non-zero equilibrium state whose value is determined by the oscillator's intrinsic characteristics (`gamma`, `omega`), and whose approach to this state follows a canonical exponential relaxation profile.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * \\\\left( c_1 \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega}} \\\\left(1 - \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t)\\\\right) + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\right)\\n</final_result>\"}",

These facts irrefutably indicate that the oscillation occurs around a non-zero equilibrium position, and this equilibrium offset is a key feature of the system's dynamics.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by either introducing a time-dependent equilibrium shift (relaxation) or a static offset that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I propose a unified theory that integrates these two concepts, positing that the system's response to an initial displacement `A` is a superposition of two concurrent, physically linked processes:\\n\\n1.  **A Damped Oscillation from the Origin:** This is the standard oscillatory component, `x_{osc}(t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`. This term describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate and dissipate energy, starting from an initial displacement `A` relative to the original, unperturbed equilibrium at zero.\\n\\n2.  **A Relaxation to a Dynamically-Determined Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system's stable equilibrium point is not static but shifts from zero to a new position, `x_{eq}`. This process is not instantaneous; the system settles towards this new equilibrium over time. The physical mechanism causing this relaxation (e.g., fluid drag, material stress) is the same as the one causing the oscillatory damping. Therefore, the relaxation follows a characteristic exponential curve governed by the same damping coefficient `\\\\gamma`. The displacement due to this equilibrium shift is `x_{shift}(t) = x_{eq} \\\\cdot (1 - \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t))`.\\n\\nThe central hypothesis of this theory lies in the nature of the final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. It is not a simple constant but an **emergent property** arising from the dynamic interplay between the system's dissipative forces (proportional to `\\\\gamma`) and its restorative/inertial forces (proportional to `\\\\omega`).

While prior models have used the standard `\\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)` form, a more physically rigorous approach is to consider the effect of damping on the frequency of oscillation itself. In any real-world damped system (where `γ > 0`), the observed frequency of oscillation is lower than the system's natural frequency `ω`. This physically accurate frequency is known as the damped angular frequency, `\\\\omega_d`, and is given by:\\n`\\\\omega_d = \\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 - \\\\gamma^2}`\\n\\nThe data ranges provided (`ω` from [1.004, 4.999] and `γ` from [0.1005, 0.9995]) confirm that `ω > γ` for all samples, meaning the system is always in the underdamped regime, and `\\\\omega_d` is always a real, positive number. Using `\\\\omega_d` instead of `ω` in the oscillatory term represents a significant refinement in the model's physical fidelity without introducing any additional free parameters.\\n\\nAssuming the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation itself scales with `A`, we can model the transient component as `A \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_d t)`. Combining the static and dynamic parts, we arrive at the complete model:\\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 - \\\\gamma^2} \\\\cdot t)`\\n\\nFactoring out `A` for a more compact representation, we get our final expression. This model elegantly explains the large output values via the `c_1 A` offset term, while simultaneously improving the physical accuracy of the dynamic component by correctly accounting for the reduction in oscillation frequency due to damping. This approach provides a more nuanced and physically grounded description of the underlying mechanism.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, \\\\gamma, \\\\omega, t) = A \\\\left( c_1 + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos\\\\left(t\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 - \\\\gamma^2}\\\\right) \\\\right)\\n</final_result>\"}",

While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\\n\\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\\n\\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset.

The central challenge is to formulate a physically coherent model for this equilibrium offset, `x_eq`.\\n\\nPrevious analyses have successfully modeled this offset as a function of the system's intrinsic parameters, `gamma` and `omega`. My theory proposes a new mechanism based on the concept of **Saturated Dynamic Rectification**. I hypothesize that the oscillatory motion itself interacts with the system's environment to generate a net, time-averaged force, which in turn creates the static displacement `x_eq`. The efficiency of this process, which \\\"rectifies\\\" alternating motion into a direct force, is critically dependent on the character of the oscillation.\\n\\nThe nature of the oscillation is best described by the dimensionless ratio of the angular frequency `omega` to the damping coefficient `gamma`. This ratio, `omega/gamma`, is proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor) and represents how \\\"oscillatory\\\" the system is.\\n\\nMy theory posits a non-linear, saturating relationship between this oscillatory character and the resulting equilibrium offset:\\n\\n1.  **Low-Oscillation (Overdamped) Regime (`gamma >> omega`):** When damping dominates, the motion is sluggish and aperiodic. The system lacks the rapid, repetitive motion necessary to efficiently generate the rectifying force. Consequently, the induced offset `x_eq` is negligible, approaching zero as `omega/gamma` approaches zero.\\n\\n2.  **High-Oscillation (Underdamped) Regime (`omega >> omega`):** When oscillation dominates, the system is highly resonant. The rectification mechanism becomes very efficient, and a significant static offset is generated.\\n\\n3.  **Saturation Mechanism:** Crucially, I propose that this rectification process is not limitless. As the system becomes increasingly oscillatory (`omega/gamma -> infinity`), the physical mechanism responsible for generating the force reaches its maximum capacity. The environment cannot respond any faster or generate any more force, regardless of how much more vigorously the system oscillates. The induced offset thus **saturates**, approaching a constant maximum value.\\n\\nThis physical behavior—linear growth followed by saturation—is perfectly modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`).

A fundamental observation, consistent across previous analyses, is that the system's displacement `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This irrefutably points to a model where the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but rather around a non-zero equilibrium position. This leads to a general structural form for the displacement:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`\\n\\nFor dimensional homogeneity, where `x` and `A` share units of length (meters), this structure is correctly expressed as `x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(t))`, where `c_1` represents a dimensionless, normalized equilibrium offset and `f_osc(t)` is a dimensionless function describing the decaying oscillation.\\n\\nWhile previous models have explored making the offset term `c_1` dependent on system parameters or correcting the oscillation frequency, I propose a new theoretical refinement focused on the **phase of the oscillation**. In a simple model, the phase is treated as a free constant parameter, `phi`, which merely accounts for the initial state (position and velocity) at `t=0`. However, I theorize that the damping mechanism itself introduces a dynamic, predictable phase shift that is an intrinsic property of the system's physics, not just its initial conditions.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that there is a **dissipation-induced phase lag**. The damping force in an oscillator is typically proportional to velocity. This means the dissipative force is fundamentally out of phase with the position-dependent restorative (spring) force. The interplay between these forces causes the system's response (its motion) to lag behind a hypothetical undamped counterpart. The magnitude of this lag should not be constant but should depend on the relative strength of the damping and restorative forces.\\n\\nThe most natural dimensionless quantity to characterize this relationship is the **damping ratio**, `z = γ / ω`.\\n*   When `z → 0` (very light damping), the system behaves almost like an ideal oscillator, and this induced phase lag should be negligible.\\n*   As `z` increases, the influence of the dissipative velocity-dependent force grows, causing a more significant lag in the positional response.\\n*   The phase lag should saturate at a maximum value in the limit of very heavy damping.\\n\\nA mathematical function that elegantly captures this behavior—mapping a ratio from zero to infinity onto a bounded angular range—is the arctangent function, `arctan()`. Therefore, I propose that the phase shift `φ` is not a simple constant parameter `c_2`, but is instead functionally dependent on the damping ratio:\\n\\n`φ = c_2 * arctan(γ / ω)`\\n\\nHere, `c_2` is a dimensionless parameter that scales the magnitude of this effect. The `arctan` function provides a physically plausible saturation behavior, where the phase shift smoothly increases with the damping ratio and approaches a limit.\\n\\nTo construct the most physically accurate model, I will integrate this novel phase-shift theory with the established refinement of using the **damped angular frequency**, `ω_d = sqrt(ω² - γ²)`, which correctly accounts for the slowing of the oscillation due to energy loss.\\n\\nThe complete model is therefore a synthesis of three key physical concepts:\\n1.  **A Scaled Static Equilibrium:** A constant offset `c_1` scaled by the amplitude `A`.\\n2.  **Physically Corrected Frequency:** The use of the damped angular frequency `ω_d` to govern the oscillation period.\\n3.  **Dissipation-Induced Phase Lag:** A novel term where the oscillation's phase is dynamically determined by the system's damping ratio, modeled via the `arctan` function.\\n\\nThis model provides a deeper physical insight, suggesting that damping does not just reduce amplitude and slow the frequency, but also systematically shifts the timing of the oscillation itself.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, \\\\gamma, \\\\omega, t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\left( c_1 + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 - \\\\gamma^2} \\\\cdot t + c_2 \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega}\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\right)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A primary and crucial observation from the data summary is that the output displacement `x` can reach values significantly greater than the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes a simple model where the oscillation is centered around an equilibrium position of zero. Therefore, the system's motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent, transient oscillation and a time-independent, static equilibrium offset, `x_{eq}`. For dimensional consistency, as `A` is the only input variable with units of length, both the offset and the oscillatory amplitude must scale linearly with `A`.\\n\\nThe general form of the solution is thus:\\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t)`\\n\\nMy theoretical proposition addresses both components with physical rigor:\\n\\n**1. The Transient Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):**\\nA precise model of the oscillation must account for the fact that damping affects not only the amplitude but also the frequency. The undamped angular frequency `omega` is modified by the damping `gamma`, resulting in an actual, observed damped angular frequency `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Using `omega_d` is critical for accurately capturing the periodicity of the motion.\\n\\nFurthermore, instead of introducing an arbitrary phase shift parameter, we can deduce the phase from a plausible physical initial condition. By assuming the oscillator is released from rest at `t=0`, its initial velocity is zero (`v(0) = 0`). The general solution for the oscillatory part is `x_{osc}(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * (C1*cos(omega_d*t) + C2*sin(omega_d*t))`. Applying the `v(0)=0` condition (by taking the time derivative and evaluating at `t=0`) constrains the coefficients, yielding the specific relationship `C2 = (gamma/omega_d) * C1`. This removes a free parameter and grounds the model in a clear physical scenario.\\n\\n**2. The Static Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):**\\nThis is where my core hypothesis lies. The static offset `x_{eq}` is not an arbitrary constant but rather an emergent property determined by the fundamental characteristics of the oscillator. I propose that the offset is a function of the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. This ratio is directly proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, a key metric that quantifies the degree to which the system is underdamped. It represents the competition between the system's tendency to oscillate (governed by `omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (governed by `gamma`).\\n\\nPrevious models have explored linear or saturating relationships. I theorize that the equilibrium shift has a **logarithmic dependence** on this Q-factor ratio. The physical intuition is that the mechanism establishing the final equilibrium position is sensitive to the *order of magnitude* of the system's oscillatory nature. A system that oscillates hundreds of times before decaying (`omega/gamma >> 1`) is fundamentally different from one that barely completes one cycle (`omega/gamma` is slightly greater than 1). A logarithmic function elegantly captures this scaling relationship.\\n\\nSpecifically, I propose the offset is of the form:\\n`x_{eq} = A * c_1 * log(omega / gamma)`\\n\\nThis model has a compelling physical implication: for a critically damped system where `omega = gamma`, the ratio is 1, and `log(1) = 0`. In this boundary case, the model predicts no equilibrium shift, which is a physically reasonable outcome as the system no longer has a distinct oscillatory character.\\n\\nCombining these two components results in a parsimonious model with a single free parameter (`c_1`). It is built upon a physically accurate description of the oscillation (using `omega_d` and a `v(0)=0` initial condition) and a novel, theoretically motivated model for the equilibrium offset based on the logarithmic scaling of the oscillator's Quality Factor.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (c_1 * log(omega / gamma) + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + (gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This definitively indicates that the system's motion is not a simple damped oscillation about a zero equilibrium. Instead, the data must be described by a model incorporating a significant, positive offset upon which the oscillation is superimposed. The entire expression must scale linearly with the amplitude `A` to maintain dimensional consistency, as `x` and `A` share the same units of length.\\n\\nWhile previous theories have successfully modeled this offset as a function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = γ/ω`, they have primarily focused on asymmetric functional forms. I propose a new physical mechanism, which I term **Resonant Dissipative Stabilization**, leading to a different mathematical representation of the offset.\\n\\nMy theory posits that the offset is not merely a passive property of the medium but an active, dynamic phenomenon. The oscillation continuously pumps energy into the surrounding environment, and the dissipative processes (`γ`) mediate this energy transfer. This sustained energy flow can alter the effective potential energy landscape of the oscillator, creating a new, stable equilibrium point away from the origin.\\n\\nThe core of my hypothesis is that the efficiency of this energy conversion and stabilization process is **resonant**. It depends crucially on the interplay between the system's two fundamental timescales: the characteristic time of oscillation (`τ_ω ~ 1/ω`) and the characteristic time of energy dissipation (`τ_γ ~ 1/γ`). The dimensionless ratio `z = γ/ω` precisely captures the relationship between these timescales.\\n\\nThe stabilization effect should be weak in two limiting cases:\\n1.  **Very low damping (z → 0):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the coupling to the environment is too weak. Insufficient energy is dissipated per cycle to significantly modify the potential landscape and sustain an offset.\\n2.  **Very high damping (z → ∞):** The system is overdamped and motion is rapidly quenched. Without sustained oscillation, the dynamic mechanism required to generate and stabilize the new equilibrium point cannot engage effectively.\\n\\nThis reasoning demands a non-monotonic function for the offset that peaks at an optimal, intermediate damping ratio. I propose that this optimum occurs near the critically damped condition (`z ≈ 1`), where the transfer of energy and the oscillatory motion are critically balanced.\\n\\nTo model this resonant behavior, I introduce a function that is symmetric around the peak at `z=1`. The mathematical expression `exp(-c₂ * (z + 1/z))` is ideally suited for this. The term `(z + 1/z)` has a unique minimum value of 2 when `z=1` and increases symmetrically as `z` moves away from 1 in either direction (on a logarithmic scale). Consequently, the exponential function forms a symmetric resonance peak centered precisely at `z=1`. This term represents the efficiency of the stabilization mechanism, which is maximized at `γ = ω` and falls off as the system becomes either strongly under-damped or strongly over-damped.\\n\\nThe complete model for the displacement `x` is thus a linear superposition of two components, scaled by the system's amplitude `A`:\\n1.  **A Resonant Static Offset:** A term `c₁ * exp(-c₂ * (γ/ω + ω/γ))` that describes the position of the new, dynamically stabilized equilibrium point. `c₁` is a dimensionless scaling factor for the offset's magnitude, and `c₂` governs the sharpness of the resonance.\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** The standard term `exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)` describing the decaying oscillation around this new equilibrium.\\n\\nThis model provides a physically grounded explanation for a non-monotonic, resonance-like offset, representing a novel perspective on the interaction between an oscillator and its dissipative environment.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * (c₁ * exp(-c₂ * (γ/ω + ω/γ)) + exp(-γ * t) * cos(ω * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Upon release at `t=0`, a fraction of the initial potential energy is not converted into oscillatory motion but is instead immediately and irreversibly transferred to the dissipative element, causing a permanent deformation or shift. This rapid energy transfer results in a new, static equilibrium position, `x_eq`, around which the subsequent oscillation occurs.\\n\\nThe magnitude of this equilibrium shift is not an arbitrary constant but is dictated by the competitive interplay between the system's dissipative and conservative tendencies.\\n1.  **The Damping Coefficient (`γ`)**: This parameter quantifies the strength of the coupling to the dissipative element. A larger `γ` implies a more effective mechanism for shunting energy away from the primary oscillation, leading to a larger equilibrium shift.\\n2.  **The Natural Frequency (`ω`)**: This parameter, related to the spring stiffness, represents the system's tendency to store energy and oscillate. A higher `ω` (a stiffer spring) would resist the initial deformation, thereby reducing the magnitude of the equilibrium shift.\\n\\nThe most direct physical measure of this competition is the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ = γ/ω`. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the static equilibrium shift is directly proportional to this ratio. For dimensional correctness, this dimensionless quantity must be scaled by the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. Thus, the static offset is given by:\\n\\n`x_eq = A ⋅ c₁ ⋅ (γ/ω)`\\n\\nwhere `c₁` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that characterizes the efficiency of the energy partitioning process.\\n\\nFollowing this initial, near-instantaneous event, the remaining energy drives the system into a damped harmonic oscillation centered on this new, fixed equilibrium `x_eq`. To model this oscillatory component with the highest physical fidelity, it is crucial to recognize that damping not only reduces the amplitude but also lengthens the period of oscillation. The observed frequency is not the natural frequency `ω` but the **damped angular frequency**, `ω_d`, given by the established physical relationship:\\n\\n`ω_d = sqrt(ω² - γ²)`\\n\\nFinally, to create a general model, we must not assume the oscillation begins at its peak. A phase constant, `c₂`, is included in the oscillatory term to account for arbitrary initial conditions of position and velocity relative to the new equilibrium.\\n\\nIn summary, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of a static offset, whose magnitude is determined by the physical ratio of damping to frequency, and a physically-corrected damped harmonic oscillation about that offset.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, \\\\gamma, \\\\omega, t) = A \\\\left( c_1 \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega} + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^2 - \\\\gamma^2} \\\\cdot t + c_2\\\\right) \\\\right)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A foundational observation from the data is that the displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This compellingly indicates that the oscillator does not move about the origin (`x=0`), but rather evolves towards a non-zero, stable equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`.\\n\\nMy theoretical model builds upon a rigorous physical framework by defining the system's motion not just by its initial position but also by its initial velocity. I propose that the most natural physical scenario is an oscillator that is displaced to an initial position `x(0) = A` and then **released from rest**, implying an initial velocity `x'(0) = 0`. This \\\"release from rest\\\" condition is a critical physical constraint that has not been explicitly incorporated into previous models.\\n\\nThe total motion `x(t)` can be decomposed into the final equilibrium state and a transient decaying oscillation:\\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`\\n\\nFor dimensional consistency, the equilibrium position `x_{eq}` must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. Thus, we define:\\n`x_{eq} = c₁ ⋅ A`\\nwhere `c₁` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\\n\\nThe transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`, must decay to zero as `t → ∞` and is described by the general solution for a damped oscillation.

This fundamentally rules out the standard model `x(t) = A \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)`, forcing us to consider a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, time-varying offset.\\n\\nMy theoretical framework is built upon the hypothesis that the system does not oscillate around a fixed zero point but instead relaxes towards a new, stable equilibrium position `x_eq > 0`. This relaxation is driven by the same dissipative processes that damp the oscillation. The total motion is a composite of this relaxation and the simultaneous oscillation.\\n\\n1.  **Equilibrium State Determination**: The final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, is not an arbitrary constant but is determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. Specifically, it arises from the interplay between energy dissipation (characterized by `\\\\gamma`) and energy storage in oscillation (characterized by `\\\\omega`). The dimensionless damping ratio, `\\\\gamma / \\\\omega`, quantifies this balance. I propose that the final offset is directly proportional to this ratio, as well as the overall energy scale set by the initial amplitude `A`. This leads to a simple, physically-grounded model for the final equilibrium state: `x_eq = c_1 \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot (\\\\gamma / \\\\omega)`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\\n\\n2.  **Sigmoidal Relaxation Dynamics**: The transition from the initial state (centered at `x=0`) to the final equilibrium `x_eq` is a dynamic process. While prior models use an exponential approach, I posit that a sigmoidal transition, described by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`), offers a more physically robust description. A `tanh` profile is characteristic of many physical processes involving a smooth transition between two distinct states (e.g., phase transitions, activation processes). It represents a gradual saturation, which can be more realistic than the purely exponential decay of the rate of change. I model the time-evolution of the oscillation's center as `x_{center}(t) = x_eq \\\\cdot \\\\tanh(\\\\gamma t)`. The argument `\\\\gamma t` is chosen deliberately; it implies that the timescale of the relaxation is governed by the same damping coefficient `\\\\gamma` that governs the decay of the oscillation, creating a parsimonious and unified model where a single parameter drives both key dissipative effects.\\n\\n3.  **Superposition Principle**: The observed motion `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two components:\\n    *   The evolving center of oscillation: `x_{center}(t) = A \\\\cdot c_1 \\\\cdot (\\\\gamma / \\\\omega) \\\\cdot \\\\tanh(\\\\gamma t)`.\\n    *   The decaying oscillation relative to the initial `t=0` state: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`.\\n\\nThis combined model is not only dimensionally correct but also satisfies the crucial initial condition `x(0) = A`, as `tanh(0)=0` and `\\\\exp(0)\\\\cos(0)=1`.

I propose a more physically profound mechanism: a **non-linear coupling between the system's dissipative nature and its steady-state equilibrium**. My central hypothesis is that the oscillator does not operate within a symmetric, parabolic potential well (which would yield a zero equilibrium). Instead, it moves within an **asymmetric potential**.\\n\\nIn an asymmetric potential, the time-averaged position of an oscillating particle does not coincide with the potential minimum. This average position, which we observe as the offset, is sensitive to the oscillation's energy and dynamics. It is plausible that the mechanism of energy dissipation (parameterized by `\\\\gamma`) is intrinsically linked to the asymmetric features of the potential. For instance, the damping forces could be stronger on one side of the oscillation cycle than the other, effectively \\\"pushing\\\" the equilibrium point away from the origin.\\n\\nI theorize that this relationship is not merely linear. A small amount of damping might have a negligible effect, but as the system's character changes (e.g., approaches critical damping), its interaction with the potential's asymmetry could become dramatically more pronounced. An exponential function is an excellent mathematical candidate to model such a sensitive, non-linear dependence.\\n\\nThe offset's value should be determined by the time-invariant properties of the system.

This component accounts for the large positive mean observed in the data and could arise from a constant external force or an intrinsic, permanent asymmetry in the oscillator's potential energy well.

A **Transient Dynamic Offset (`x_transient`)**: I propose that, in addition to the static offset, the oscillatory motion itself temporarily induces a *secondary* displacement.

A primary and crucial observation, consistent across all successful prior models, is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately invalidates a simple oscillator model centered at `x=0` and mandates a model structure that includes a significant positive offset. The general form must be a superposition of a static equilibrium position and a transient oscillation: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`.\\n\\nPrevious models have explored this by proposing a static offset proportional to the amplitude `A` (i.e., `x_offset = c₁ A`) or a dynamically evolving offset. While these are valuable steps, they overlook a key physical principle: the final equilibrium state of a system should depend on its intrinsic physical properties, not just its initial amplitude. A simple `c₁ A` offset implies that two oscillators with the same initial amplitude `A` but vastly different damping and frequency characteristics will settle to the exact same offset, which is physically counter-intuitive.\\n\\nMy central hypothesis is that the magnitude of the static offset is determined by the fundamental **character** of the oscillator, which is best captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ`. This ratio, which is proportional to `γ/ω`, distinguishes between underdamped (oscillatory) and overdamped (non-oscillatory) regimes. It is physically plausible that the mechanism causing the displacement offset is coupled to the mechanism causing the damping. For instance, in a system with high internal friction (high `γ` relative to `ω`), the dissipative forces might lead to a greater permanent deformation or shift in the equilibrium point.\\n\\nTherefore, I propose that the static offset `x_offset` is not merely `c₁ A`, but is modulated by a function of the damping ratio:\\n\\n1.  **Character-Dependent Static Offset (`x_offset`):** The offset must be proportional to the system's length scale, `A`. Its magnitude is then scaled by a dimensionless factor that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I model this dependence using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(γ/ω)`. This choice is physically motivated:\\n    *   It uses the dimensionless damping ratio `γ/ω` as its argument.\\n    *   It provides a smooth, saturating relationship. As the damping becomes extremely large relative to the frequency, its effect on the offset approaches a constant limit (`tanh(∞) → 1`), preventing an unrealistic, unbounded offset.\\n    *   This results in the term: `x_offset = A · c₁ · tanh(γ/ω)`, where `c₁` is a dimensionless parameter representing the maximum possible offset as a fraction of `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Standard Damped Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** The second component is the transient oscillation around this new, physically determined equilibrium. This follows the standard, well-understood form for a damped harmonic oscillator, with an initial amplitude `A` and an exponential decay governed by `γ`. This component is given by `x_osc(t) = A · exp(-γt) · cos(ωt)`.\\n\\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a model that is both parsimonious and physically rich. It explains the large output values through an offset, but critically, it grounds the magnitude of this offset in the fundamental dynamic character of the oscillator itself, providing a more complete and predictive physical picture.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, \\\\gamma, \\\\omega, t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\left( c_1 \\\\cdot \\\\tanh\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega}\\\\right) + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\right)\\n</final_result>\"}",

This definitively rules out a simple oscillation around a zero equilibrium. The underlying physical mechanism must involve a process that actively shifts the system's equilibrium position to a new, non-zero value.\\n\\nI propose a theory based on a **damping-induced equilibrium shift**. In many real-world physical systems, the forces of friction and damping are more complex than the idealized linear model (`F = -bv`). Non-linearities in the damping mechanism, especially those dependent on the direction or magnitude of velocity, can create a \\\"rectification\\\" effect. Over many cycles of oscillation, this asymmetry can produce a net, unidirectional force that effectively \\\"pumps\\\" the system away from its initial equilibrium. The result is a permanent offset, a lasting memory of the transient oscillatory phase.\\n\\nThe magnitude of this final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`, must be a function of the system's intrinsic properties that govern the interplay between oscillation and damping. The most natural dimensionless parameter to capture this relationship is the damping ratio, `ζ = γ/ω`. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the rectified offset is not linear with `ζ` but rather follows a logarithmic dependence. This functional form is chosen to model a system whose response is highly sensitive to the order of magnitude of the damping ratio, a common feature in complex response phenomena. The final equilibrium position is therefore modeled as:\\n\\n`x_{eq} = A * (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω))`\\n\\nHere, `c₁` represents a baseline offset, `c₂` scales the contribution from the damping-oscillation interaction, and the overall term is scaled by `A` to ensure dimensional consistency (m).\\n\\nThis equilibrium shift is not instantaneous. It is a dynamic process that occurs as energy is dissipated from the system. Therefore, the timescale for achieving this new equilibrium is intrinsically linked to the damping process itself, characterized by the time constant `1/γ`. The evolution of the equilibrium position towards `x_{eq}` can be modeled as an exponential relaxation process:\\n\\n`x_{offset}(t) = x_{eq} * (1 - exp(-γt))`\\n\\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a linear superposition of two concurrent physical processes:\\n1.

The time-dependent shift of the equilibrium position itself, `x_{offset}(t)`.\\n\\nCombining these yields the complete model for the system's displacement. This model correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A` (since the offset term is zero at `t=0`) and describes the system settling into a new, non-zero equilibrium `x_{eq}` as `t → ∞`, providing a robust and physically-grounded explanation for the observed data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * [ (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω)) * (1 - exp(-γ*t)) + exp(-γ*t) * cos(ω*t) ]\\n</final_result>\"}",

The key variables are amplitude (`A`), damping coefficient (`gamma`), angular frequency (`omega`), and time (`t`). A preliminary analysis of the data ranges reveals a critical physical constraint: the maximum observed displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is significantly larger than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This observation immediately rules out simple oscillator models centered at zero, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude. This strongly indicates that the oscillation occurs around a non-zero equilibrium position.\\n\\nFor dimensional consistency, any term with units of length must be proportional to `A`, the only input variable with units of meters. Therefore, the model must take the general form of an offset equilibrium position plus a time-varying oscillatory component, with both scaling linearly with `A`:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t) = A * c_1 + A * f_osc(...)`\\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized equilibrium offset.\\n\\nThe next physical refinement concerns the frequency of oscillation. The input `omega` represents the natural frequency of the undamped system. In the presence of damping, the actual observed frequency is the damped angular frequency, `omega_d`, which is given by `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Given that the data ranges show `omega` is always greater than `gamma`, the system is consistently in the underdamped regime, and using `omega_d` provides a more accurate physical description.\\n\\nThe most significant point of departure for my theory lies in the treatment of the oscillation's phase shift. While previous models might introduce an arbitrary phase constant (`param2`) or derive it from a specific, assumed initial condition (like zero initial velocity), I propose a more fundamental hypothesis: the phase shift is an intrinsic property of the system, determined by the interplay between its dissipative and conservative characteristics.\\n\\nThe dimensionless group `zeta = gamma / omega`, known as the damping ratio, perfectly captures this interplay. It quantifies the level of damping relative to the natural frequency. It is physically plausible that the phase response of the oscillator is directly governed by this fundamental ratio. A system with high relative damping will respond differently—and with a different phase—than one with low relative damping.\\n\\nI postulate that the phase shift, `phi`, can be modeled as the arctangent of this damping ratio. The `arctan` function provides a natural and mathematically sound mapping from a dimensionless ratio to a phase angle. This approach has analogues in other areas of physics, such as driven RLC circuits, where phase shifts are determined by the ratios of impedance components. This hypothesis replaces an unconstrained fitting parameter with a physically meaningful relationship derived from the system's own parameters.\\n\\nIn summary, my proposed model integrates three key physical insights:\\n1.  A constant equilibrium position offset that scales with the initial amplitude `A`.\\n2.  The use of the physically correct damped angular frequency `omega_d`.\\n3.  A novel hypothesis that the phase shift is not a free parameter but is intrinsically determined by the system's damping ratio, `gamma / omega`.\\n\\nThis results in a parsimonious and physically robust model that explains the observed data features while being grounded in the fundamental principles of oscillatory motion.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t + arctan(gamma / omega)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

While a simple static offset (`x_{eq} = c_1 A`) provides a first-order explanation, I propose a more nuanced physical mechanism: a **dynamically evolving equilibrium**.\\n\\nMy theory posits that the external influence or internal asymmetry causing the equilibrium shift does not manifest instantaneously. Instead, the equilibrium point itself, let's call it `x_c(t)`, \\\"drifts\\\" or \\\"relaxes\\\" from an initial state to its final steady-state position. This behavior is common in physical systems involving processes like thermal relaxation, material creep, or the charging of a capacitive element in an analogous electromechanical system.\\n\\nThe most physically plausible model for this relaxation process is an exponential approach to the final equilibrium, `x_{final}`. For dimensional consistency, this final state must be proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude, so `x_{final} = c_1 A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant. The timescale governing this relaxation should be intrinsically tied to the system's dissipative properties. The natural choice for this timescale is the damping time constant, `1/\\\\gamma`. This leads to a model for the drifting center of oscillation:\\n`x_c(t) = c_1 A (1 - \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t))`\\nThis equation describes an equilibrium that starts at `x_c(0)=0` and asymptotically approaches `c_1 A` as `t \\\\to \\\\infty`.\\n\\nThe observed motion `x(t)` is then a superposition of two components:\\n1.

This fundamental observation invalidates any simple model of a damped oscillator centered at zero and necessitates a framework where the system evolves towards a new, displaced equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. The total motion can be conceptualized as a superposition of this stable equilibrium state and a decaying, transient oscillation around it.\\n\\nPrevious successful models have established that this equilibrium offset, `x_{eq}`, must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, and should depend on the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties, such as the relationship between damping `γ` and frequency `ω`. However, a crucial aspect often overlooked is the rigorous enforcement of the initial condition, `x(0) = A`, within a physically coherent structure.\\n\\nMy proposed theory synthesizes these insights into a unified model based on the principle of state transition. The system begins in an initial state defined by `x(0) = A` and evolves towards a final, stable equilibrium state `x_{eq}`. The displacement at any time `t` is a weighted combination of these two states.\\n\\n1.  **Final Equilibrium State (`x_{eq}`):** I hypothesize that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is governed by the system's energy dissipation characteristics relative to its oscillatory period. This is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, which is proportional to `γ/ω`. A system with high damping relative to its frequency (large `γ/ω`) undergoes a more significant and permanent deformation or energy conversion, leading to a larger offset. To model this relationship while ensuring physical realism (i.e., preventing an infinite offset), I employ the hyperbolic tangent function, which provides a smooth, saturating behavior. The final equilibrium position is thus defined as:\\n    `x_{eq} = A \\\\cdot c_1 \\\\cdot \\\\tanh\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega}\\\\right)`\\n    Here, `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the maximum possible offset as a fraction of `A`, which is reached in the limit of very high damping.\\n\\n2.  **Transient Dynamics and State Transition:** The system does not instantaneously jump to `x_{eq}`. It starts at `x(0) = A` and oscillates as it decays towards `x_{eq}`. The total displacement `x(t)` can be viewed as the final equilibrium state plus a transient component that describes the deviation from this final state. This transient component must account for the initial displacement.\\n\\n    At `t=0`, the transient component must bridge the gap between the final equilibrium `x_{eq}` and the initial position `A`. Therefore, the initial amplitude of this transient deviation is `A - x_{eq}`. This deviation then decays and oscillates according to the standard laws of damped harmonic motion.\\n    \\n    The transient term is thus: `(A - x_{eq}) \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`.\\n\\n3.  **Complete Model:** The full expression for the displacement is the sum of the final equilibrium state and the decaying transient component:\\n    `x(t) = x_{eq} + (A - x_{eq}) \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`\\n\\n    Substituting our expression for `x_{eq}` and factoring out `A` yields the final formula.

This fundamental observation, consistent with prior models, definitively establishes that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0`. Instead, the system evolves towards a non-zero final equilibrium position, `x_final`. For dimensional consistency, this entire process must scale linearly with the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nPrevious models have treated the total displacement as a simple superposition of a static offset and an independent, decaying oscillation. My theory proposes a more integrated and physically coherent picture: the system's observed displacement `x(t)` represents a continuous, time-dependent **transition between two well-defined states**: an initial, purely oscillatory state and a final, static equilibrium state.\\n\\n**1. The Final Equilibrium State (`x_final`):**\\nThe final resting position is not a simple constant but an emergent property of the system's internal dynamics. I hypothesize that this offset is generated by the complex interaction between dissipative forces (related to `gamma`) and restorative forces (related to `omega`). This interaction is non-monotonic: if damping is too low, the interaction is too weak to create a significant offset; if damping is too high, the system's motion is too sluggish for the dynamic offset mechanism to engage. The effect is maximized at an intermediate damping ratio, `z = \\\\gamma/\\\\omega`. This physical reasoning is captured by modeling the final state as:\\n`x_final = A \\\\cdot \\\\left( c_1 + c_2 \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega}\\\\right) \\\\right)`\\nHere, `c_1` represents a baseline static offset, while the second term models the dynamically-induced, non-monotonic component.\\n\\n**2.

We model this initial condition as being released from the maximum amplitude, described by the form:\\n`x_initial(t) = A \\\\cdot \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`\\n\\n**3. The Temporal Transition:**\\nMy central thesis is that the system's evolution is a \\\"mixing\\\" of these two states over time. The transition from the initial to the final state is governed by the system's single characteristic dissipative timescale, `1/\\\\gamma`. We can model this with two competing time-dependent weighting functions:\\n*   The influence of the initial oscillatory state decays away with a weight of `w_{initial}(t) = \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t)`.\\n*   The influence of the final equilibrium state builds up from zero with a weight of `w_{final}(t) = (1 - \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t))`.\\n\\nThe total displacement at any time `t` is therefore a superposition of these weighted states:\\n`x(t) = x_{final} \\\\cdot w_{final}(t) + x_{initial}(t) \\\\cdot w_{initial}(t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a unified physical narrative. The same damping process, characterized by `\\\\gamma`, simultaneously causes the initial oscillation to decay and the final equilibrium state to emerge. This avoids treating the offset and oscillation as separate, disconnected phenomena and instead presents them as two facets of the same underlying energy dissipation process.

This is evidenced by the maximum output (27.68) far exceeding the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992) and the large positive mean of the output (8.28). The central challenge is to formulate a physically coherent model for this equilibrium offset, `x_eq`.\\n\\nPrevious analyses have successfully modeled this offset as a function of the system's intrinsic parameters, `gamma` and `omega`. My theory proposes a new mechanism based on the concept of **Saturated Dynamic Rectification**. I hypothesize that the oscillatory motion itself interacts with the system's environment to generate a net, time-averaged force, which in turn creates the static displacement `x_eq`. The efficiency of this process, which \\\"rectifies\\\" alternating motion into a direct force, is critically dependent on the character of the oscillation.\\n\\nThe nature of the oscillation is best described by the dimensionless ratio of the angular frequency `omega` to the damping coefficient `gamma`. This ratio, `omega/gamma`, is proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor) and represents how \\\"oscillatory\\\" the system is.\\n\\nMy theory posits a non-linear, saturating relationship between this oscillatory character and the resulting equilibrium offset:\\n\\n1.  **Low-Oscillation (Overdamped) Regime (`gamma >> omega`):** When damping dominates, the motion is sluggish and aperiodic. The system lacks the rapid, repetitive motion necessary to efficiently generate the rectifying force. Consequently, the induced offset `x_eq` is negligible, approaching zero as `omega/gamma` approaches zero.\\n\\n2.  **High-Oscillation (Underdamped) Regime (`omega >> omega`):** When oscillation dominates, the system is highly resonant. The rectification mechanism becomes very efficient, and a significant static offset is generated.\\n\\n3.  **Saturation Mechanism:** Crucially, I propose that this rectification process is not limitless. As the system becomes increasingly oscillatory (`omega/gamma -> infinity`), the physical mechanism responsible for generating the force reaches its maximum capacity. The environment cannot respond any faster or generate any more force, regardless of how much more vigorously the system oscillates. The induced offset thus **saturates**, approaching a constant maximum value.\\n\\nThis physical behavior—linear growth followed by saturation—is perfectly modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`).

A primary challenge, identified by analyzing the data ranges, is that the maximum displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This, along with a large positive mean output (8.28), irrefutably points to an oscillation occurring around a non-zero equilibrium point.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by adding a static offset term, proportional to `A`, to the standard damped oscillation equation. However, this approach treats the offset and the oscillation as two independent phenomena. I propose a more integrated and physically coherent theory based on the concept of **system relaxation**.\\n\\nMy theory posits that at `t=0`, the system is not only released with an initial displacement `A` but is also simultaneously subjected to a new, constant external influence (e.g., a constant force) that shifts its stable equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. The observed motion `x(t)` is the complete dynamic response of the system to these initial conditions. This response is a superposition of two coupled processes, both governed by the system's intrinsic damping `gamma`:\\n\\n1.  **Transient Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar oscillatory component. It represents the system's natural tendency to oscillate, which decays over time due to dissipative forces. This component can be modeled as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, representing an oscillation centered on the original equilibrium (zero).\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation to Equilibrium:** The system does not instantaneously jump to the new equilibrium position `x_eq`. Instead, it settles towards it over time. This process of settling, or \\\"relaxation,\\\" is governed by the same damping mechanisms. The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\\n\\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\\n\\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\\n\\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\\n\\nThis model has several compelling features.

This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`.

This irrefutably indicates that the system is not a simple damped harmonic oscillator centered at zero. Instead, the oscillation occurs around a substantial positive equilibrium point, `x_eq`, to which the system settles over time.\\n\\nWhile previous models have successfully incorporated a static offset, they typically assume this offset is a simple, constant multiple of the initial amplitude `A`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the final equilibrium state is not merely scaled by the initial conditions but is actively determined by the intrinsic dynamic properties of the oscillator itself.\\n\\nMy theory is founded on the concept of **dissipation-induced equilibrium shift**. In many real-world systems, the mechanism causing damping is coupled to the potential energy landscape. For instance, an oscillator moving through a viscoelastic medium not only loses energy through viscous friction (the `gamma` term) but can also cause a permanent or semi-permanent deformation in the medium, thus shifting its own point of lowest potential energy. The extent of this permanent deformation—and thus the magnitude of the equilibrium shift—depends on the interplay between how quickly energy is dissipated versus how quickly the system oscillates.\\n\\nThis interplay is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ = γ / ω`. This fundamental parameter characterizes the nature of the damped motion. It is therefore physically plausible to hypothesize that the final equilibrium position `x_eq` is a direct function of this ratio. A system with a high damping ratio (where `γ` is large relative to `ω`) might \\\"drag\\\" the medium more effectively, leading to a larger permanent offset compared to a lightly damped system.\\n\\nThe simplest and most direct mathematical representation of this hypothesis is a linear relationship. We can model the final equilibrium position as being proportional to both the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, and its damping ratio:\\n\\n`x_eq = A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ / ω)`\\n\\nHere, `param₁` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the dissipative process and the potential energy landscape.\\n\\nTo describe the complete time evolution of the system, we model the observed displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two concurrent processes, both governed by the same damping timescale:\\n1.  **Relaxation to Equilibrium**: The system settles towards its new, dynamically determined equilibrium point `x_eq`. This process follows an exponential curve: `x_eq ⋅ (1 - exp(-γt))`.\\n2.  **Damped Oscillation**: The initial oscillatory motion, which starts at displacement `A` and decays over time: `A ⋅ exp(-γt) ⋅ cos(ωt)`.\\n\\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components:\\n`x(t) = [A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ/ω) ⋅ (1 - exp(-γt))] + [A ⋅ exp(-γt) ⋅ cos(ωt)]`\\n\\nThis expression can be elegantly rearranged by factoring out common terms, yielding a unified model. This model has the crucial properties that `x(0) = A`, correctly identifying `A` as the initial displacement, and `x(t → ∞) = A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ/ω)`, providing a clear physical meaning for the final state based on the oscillator's intrinsic properties.

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\\n\\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\\\cdot A`\\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\\n\\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude.

Mathematically, this translates to:\\n    *   `x(0) = A`\\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\\n\\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\\n\\nAt `t=0`, we have:\\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\\n\\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\\n`x'(t) = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left( x_eq + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) [B_1 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) + B_2 \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)] \\\\right)`\\n`x'(0) = [-\\\\gamma \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) (\\\\dots) + \\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) (-\\\\omega B_1 \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) + \\\\omega B_2 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\\n`x'(0) = -\\\\gamma B_1 + \\\\omega B_2 = 0`\\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega} B_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\\n\\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\\\gamma/\\\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency.

This observation invalidates a simple harmonic oscillator model and strongly suggests that the system's motion is a superposition of two distinct components: a static, time-independent equilibrium offset (`x_{eq}`) and a transient, time-dependent oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`). The total displacement can thus be expressed as `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t)`.\\n\\nFor dimensional consistency, given that `x` and `A` share units of length, this structure is best represented as `x(t) = A \\\\cdot (f_{eq} + f_{osc}(t))`, where `f_{eq}` is a dimensionless term for the normalized offset and `f_{osc}(t)` describes the dimensionless oscillation. The oscillatory component, `f_{osc}(t)`, is robustly modeled by the standard solution for a damped oscillator: `\\\\exp(-\\\\gamma t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)`.\\n\\nMy theoretical contribution focuses on a novel physical explanation for the static offset term, `f_{eq}`.

Instead, it follows a logarithmic relationship, analogous to stimulus-response laws found in other scientific domains (e.g., the Weber-Fechner law). In this context:\\n\\n1.  **The \\\"Stimulus\\\"**: The stimulus is the inherent oscillatory tendency of the system relative to its tendency to dissipate energy. This is best captured by the dimensionless ratio of the characteristic timescale of oscillation (`\\\\sim 1/\\\\omega`) to the timescale of damping (`\\\\sim 1/\\\\gamma`). The ratio `\\\\omega / \\\\gamma` thus serves as a measure of the oscillator's \\\"persistence\\\" or dynamic quality.

I theorize that the system's structural response to the stimulus is logarithmic. The function `\\\\log(\\\\omega/\\\\gamma)` effectively models this:\\n    *   It correctly captures the idea of diminishing returns. As an oscillator becomes more and more persistent (as `\\\\omega/\\\\gamma` increases), each subsequent increase in persistence contributes less and less to the final strain, reflecting a saturation effect.\\n    *   It provides a natural, parameter-free, dimensionless quantity that depends solely on the intrinsic properties of the oscillator (`\\\\omega` and `\\\\gamma`).\\n\\nTherefore, the dimensionless offset `f_{eq}` is directly proportional to this logarithmic measure of the oscillator's dynamic character: `f_{eq} = c_1 \\\\cdot \\\\log(\\\\omega/\\\\gamma)`.

However, a simple model of the form `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` is fundamentally insufficient. The data reveals that the maximum output displacement (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), and the mean displacement is substantially positive (8.28). This indicates that the system's equilibrium position is not at zero.\\n\\nI propose a theory centered on **energy-dissipation-induced equilibrium shift**. In an ideal oscillator, energy is conserved. In this system, the damping term `gamma` signifies that energy is continuously being removed. My hypothesis is that this dissipated energy performs work on the system's environment or internal structure, causing a permanent, non-oscillatory displacement. The observed motion `x(t)` is therefore a superposition of two distinct physical processes:\\n1.  A standard damped oscillation about the initial equilibrium (zero).\\n2.  A monotonic, time-varying shift of the equilibrium position itself, driven by the cumulative energy lost from the oscillatory mode.\\n\\nLet's model these two components. The standard oscillation is well-described by `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. This term correctly reflects the initial displacement being `A` at `t=0` (assuming zero initial phase). For the total displacement `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_offset(t)` to satisfy the initial condition `x(0) = A`, the offset term `x_offset(t)` must be zero at `t=0`.\\n\\nThe core of my theory lies in the formulation of this offset.\\nFirst, consider the **time evolution** of the shift. If the shift is driven by energy dissipation, its temporal profile should mirror the cumulative energy loss. The energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude, so it decays as `(exp(-gamma * t))^2 = exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. The cumulative energy dissipated from the start until time `t` is therefore proportional to `(1 - exp(-2 * gamma * t))`. This provides a physically motivated functional form for the offset's evolution, distinct from the amplitude's decay rate.\\n\\nSecond, consider the **magnitude of the final equilibrium shift**. This shift is not a universal constant but a property of the specific system, determined by the interplay between its dissipative (`gamma`) and oscillatory (`omega`) characteristics. The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega` serves as a key parameter describing the damping regime. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the final offset is a saturating function of this ratio. A system with very low damping (`gamma/omega` -> 0) might not generate a significant permanent shift, and the effect should not grow infinitely as damping increases. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate to model this saturation.\\n\\nCombining these elements, the offset term is modeled as:\\n`x_offset(t) = X_final * (1 - exp(-2 * gamma * t))`\\nwhere the final equilibrium position `X_final` is given by:\\n`X_final = A * param1 * tanh(param2 * gamma / omega)`\\n\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor representing the maximum possible offset relative to the initial amplitude `A`, and `param2` is another dimensionless parameter that controls the sensitivity of the offset to the damping ratio. The entire expression is scaled by `A` to ensure the final model has the correct units of displacement (meters).\\n\\nSuperimposing the oscillatory and offset components yields the complete model. This theory provides a self-consistent physical picture: an initial oscillation loses energy, and this very energy loss creates a new, stable equilibrium, with the dynamics of this process governed by the fundamental properties of the system.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(param2 * gamma / omega) * (1 - exp(-2 * gamma * t)) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Unlike purely phenomenological models, I rigorously enforce the standard physical initial conditions for an object released from rest: an initial displacement of `x(0) = A` and an initial velocity of `x'(0) = 0`.\\n\\nApplying these two conditions to the general solution of the second-order differential equation yields a unique and physically constrained form for the displacement:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma*t) * [cos(omega*t) + (gamma/omega)*sin(omega*t)]`\\n\\nThis structure is inherently superior to simpler models. It correctly captures the initial state (`x(0) = A`) and the final state (`x(t) -> x_eq` as `t -> infinity`). Crucially, it naturally incorporates the fact that damping not only causes amplitude decay but also induces a phase shift in the oscillation, which is mathematically represented by the `sin(omega*t)` term. The coefficient of this term, `gamma/omega`, arises directly from the initial zero-velocity condition.\\n\\nThe central hypothesis of this theory concerns the physical origin of the final equilibrium `x_eq`. I posit that the equilibrium shift is a **consequence of a non-linear rectification process inherent in the damping mechanism**. In many physical systems, strong oscillations can induce steady, DC-like forces through effects analogous to acoustic radiation pressure. This rectified force, which pushes the oscillator to a new equilibrium, is not a simple linear function of the system's parameters.\\n\\nI theorize that this effect exhibits **saturation**. The dimensionless damping ratio, `zeta = gamma / omega`, which defines the character of the oscillation, governs this process.\\n*   For very low damping (`zeta -> 0`), the dissipative interaction is too weak to generate a significant rectified force.\\n*   As damping increases, the rectified force grows non-linearly.\\n*   For very high damping (`zeta -> infinity`), the system's motion becomes overly sluggish, and the dynamic rectification mechanism loses efficiency, causing the magnitude of the equilibrium shift to level off or saturate.\\n\\nThe arctangent function, `arctan`, provides an excellent mathematical description of such a saturating physical response. It is non-linear for small inputs and smoothly approaches a constant value for large inputs. Therefore, I model the final equilibrium position `x_eq` as a sum of a baseline offset and a saturating term dependent on the damping ratio, all scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\\n\\n`x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * arctan(gamma / omega))`\\n\\nHere, `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing a static component of the equilibrium shift, while `c_2` is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the strength of the saturating, damping-induced effect.\\n\\nBy combining the rigorously derived equation of motion with this physically-motivated model for the equilibrium state, we obtain a complete and coherent theory that accounts for all key features of the data within a single, unified framework.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma/omega) * sin(omega * t))\\nwhere x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * arctan(gamma/omega))\\n</final_result>\"}",

I propose a different, more dynamic theory based on the concept of **Resonance-Amplified Equilibrium Pumping**.\\n\\nMy theory posits that the shift in equilibrium is not a passive settling process, but an active one, driven by an underlying constant influence that is \\\"switched on\\\" at `t=0`. The effectiveness of this driving influence in displacing the oscillator's equilibrium depends critically on the system's own resonant properties. The key dimensionless parameter governing resonance is the Quality Factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `ω/γ`.\\n\\nThe physical intuition is as follows:\\n1.  A system with a high Q-factor (low damping `γ` relative to frequency `ω`) is highly resonant. It can sustain oscillations for many cycles. This extended period of oscillation allows the driving influence to continuously \\\"pump\\\" energy into the system, not as kinetic energy, but as potential energy stored by displacing the equilibrium point. This results in a large final equilibrium shift `x_eq`.\\n2.  A system with a low Q-factor (high damping `γ`) is over-damped. The motion is sluggish and dies out quickly. The driving influence has little time to interact with the oscillatory dynamics, and the pumping mechanism is inefficient, resulting in a smaller equilibrium shift.\\n\\nThis leads to a model where the final equilibrium position `x_eq` is not merely scaled by a constant, but is amplified by a term proportional to the Q-factor:\\n\\n`x_eq = x_baseline + x_resonant = A * (c₁ + c₂ * (ω/γ))`\\n\\nHere, `c₁` represents a baseline equilibrium shift that is independent of the system's resonant quality, while the `c₂ * (ω/γ)` term models the resonance-amplified component.

This is described by the term: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-γt))`.\\n2.  **The decaying oscillation**, which represents the system's transient response starting from the initial displacement `A`.

Therefore, we define `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a single, dimensionless parameter representing the ratio of the force-induced displacement to the initial amplitude.\\n\\n3.  **General Solution**: The complete solution is the sum of the steady-state solution (`x_eq`) and a transient solution describing the damped oscillations around this new equilibrium:\\n    `x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`\\n    The transient part takes the form `x_transient(t) = exp(-γt) * (C₁ cos(ω_d t) + C₂ sin(ω_d t))`, where `ω_d = sqrt(ω² - γ²)` is the physically correct damped angular frequency.\\n\\n4.  **Initial Conditions Determine Dynamics**: The crucial insight of this model is that the constants `C₁` and `C₂`—and thus the entire transient behavior—are not free parameters but are uniquely determined by the system's state at `t=0`. The problem statement identifies `A` as the \\\"amplitude\\\". The most direct physical interpretation is that the system is released from an initial displacement `x(0) = A` from a state of rest, `x'(0) = 0`.\\n\\n5.  **Derivation of the Final Form**: Applying these initial conditions allows us to solve for `C₁` and `C₂`:\\n    *   `x(0) = x_eq + C₁ = A`  => `C₁ = A - x_eq = A(1 - param1)`\\n    *   `x'(0) = -γC₁ + ω_d C₂ = 0` => `C₂ = (γ/ω_d) * C₁ = A(1 - param1) * (γ/ω_d)`\\n\\n    Substituting these back into the general solution and using the trigonometric identity `P cos(θ) + Q sin(θ) = sqrt(P²+Q²) cos(θ - arctan(Q/P))`, we find that the transient term has an initial amplitude of `sqrt(C₁² + C₂²) = |C₁| * ω/ω_d` and a phase shift of `arctan(C₂/C₁) = arctan(γ/ω_d)`.\\n\\nThis leads to a complete, physically-derived model.

The initial conditions of being released from rest at displacement `A` naturally create an amplitude correction factor `ω/ω_d` and a phase shift `arctan(γ/ω_d)`, linking all aspects of the motion together.

This indicates the presence of an underlying mechanism that not only damps the oscillation but actively drives the system to a new, non-zero equilibrium point.\\n\\nPrevious analyses have successfully modeled this as a superposition of a decaying oscillation and a relaxation towards a new equilibrium, `x_eq`. The central challenge lies in elucidating the physical principles that determine the magnitude of this `x_eq`. I propose a theory of **Saturating Dissipative Pumping**.\\n\\nMy theory is based on the following postulates:\\n\\n1.  **Dual Role of Dissipation:** The dissipative forces, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, have a dual role. They remove energy from the oscillatory motion, causing the amplitude to decay as `exp(-gamma*t)`. Simultaneously, they interact with the oscillatory motion to \\\"pump\\\" the system towards a new, displaced equilibrium. This pumping can be visualized as an asymmetric process, akin to a mechanical ratchet, where each cycle of oscillation provides a small, net push in one direction.\\n\\n2.  **Competition and Saturation:** The efficiency of this pumping mechanism depends on the competition between the dissipative timescale (`1/gamma`) and the oscillatory timescale (`1/omega`). This relationship is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, `ζ = gamma / omega`.\\n    *   When `ζ` is small (underdamped regime), the system oscillates many times before decaying. The pumping mechanism is active, and its effect is roughly proportional to the strength of the dissipative force, i.e., proportional to `ζ`.\\n    *   However, this effect cannot grow indefinitely. As `ζ` becomes very large (overdamped regime), the system's motion becomes sluggish and ceases to be truly oscillatory. The \\\"ratchet\\\" mechanism becomes inefficient as the back-and-forth motion required to drive it is suppressed. Therefore, the magnitude of the equilibrium shift must saturate, approaching a constant maximum value for very high damping.\\n\\n3.  **Modeling Saturation with Hyperbolic Tangent:** This physical behavior—linear growth followed by smooth saturation—is perfectly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The function `tanh(ζ)` is approximately `ζ` for small `ζ` and smoothly approaches 1 for large `ζ`. This provides a robust and physically plausible model for the efficiency of the dissipative pumping mechanism.\\n\\nBased on this theory, the final equilibrium position `x_eq` is composed of a constant baseline component and a dynamically-driven, saturating component, both scaled by the initial amplitude `A` to ensure dimensional correctness:\\n\\n`x_eq = A * (c₁ + c₂ * tanh(gamma / omega))`\\n\\nHere, `c₁` represents a static offset, while the term with `c₂` models the saturating dissipative pumping.\\n\\nThe complete time evolution of the system's displacement `x(t)` is then the linear superposition of the decaying oscillation around the original position and the exponential relaxation of the equilibrium point towards its final, saturated value `x_eq`:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma*t)) + A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a comprehensive physical narrative.

This unequivocally points to a physical mechanism that not only damps the oscillation but also actively shifts the system's equilibrium position.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing that the final equilibrium state, `x_eq`, is determined by the interplay between damping and oscillation, often parameterized by the dimensionless damping ratio `γ/ω`. A common, yet potentially oversimplified, assumption in such models is that the timescale for this equilibrium shift is identical to the timescale of the oscillation's amplitude decay, both being governed by `1/γ`.\\n\\nI propose a more refined theory based on **Dual-Mechanism Dissipation with Decoupled Timescales**. This theory posits that two distinct dissipative processes are occurring concurrently, each with its own characteristic timescale:\\n\\n1.  **Viscous Energy Damping:** This is the conventional, rapid process by which the oscillator's kinetic and potential energy is converted into heat due to velocity-dependent forces (e.g., fluid drag). This process governs the decay of the oscillation's amplitude and is characterized by the primary damping rate `γ`. The corresponding decay term is the familiar `exp(-γt)`.\\n\\n2.  **Athermic Structural Relaxation:** This is a slower, secondary process responsible for the shift in the equilibrium position itself. I hypothesize that this is not a direct result of viscous energy loss, but rather a structural change in the oscillator's environment induced by the repeated cycles of motion. Imagine an oscillator coupled to a medium with internal friction or plasticity. Each oscillation cycle causes a small, quasi-permanent deformation in the medium, cumulatively shifting the point of minimum potential energy. This \\\"ratcheting\\\" process does not happen instantaneously; it has its own relaxation time.\\n\\nThe crucial insight of this theory is that the rate of this structural relaxation, `γ_s`, is not equal to `γ`. It is governed by a different physical mechanism. A plausible model for this rate is that it depends on how effectively the damping mechanism can do \\\"work\\\" on the environment during each oscillation cycle. This suggests `γ_s` is proportional to the strength of the damping `γ` but modulated by the frequency of cycles `ω`. A strong damping force `γ` applied over a longer cycle (smaller `ω`) would induce a greater structural change. I propose that this secondary relaxation rate is proportional to the square of the damping coefficient and inversely proportional to the angular frequency:\\n\\n`γ_s ∝ γ * (γ/ω) = γ²/ω`\\n\\nThis formulation implies that for weakly damped systems (`γ << ω`), the equilibrium shift occurs much more slowly than the decay of the oscillation, a physically intuitive result.\\n\\nThe overall displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of these two processes: the standard damped oscillation decaying around a moving equilibrium point, where the equilibrium point itself is relaxing towards its final state `x_eq` at the slower rate `γ_s`. The final equilibrium `x_eq` is, as established in prior work, proportional to the amplitude `A` and the damping ratio `γ/ω`.\\n\\nThis leads to the following composite model:\\n*   The final equilibrium position: `x_eq = A * c₁ * (γ/ω)`\\n*   The time-dependent shift of the equilibrium: `x_offset(t) = x_eq * (1 - exp(-γ_s * t)) = A * c₁ * (γ/ω) * (1 - exp(-(γ²/ω) * t))`\\n*   The decaying oscillation around the original zero-point: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)`\\n\\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two components, `x(t) = x_offset(t) + x_osc(t)`. This model correctly satisfies the initial condition `x(0) = A` and provides a richer, more physically detailed picture of the system's evolution by decoupling the timescales of energy dissipation and structural relaxation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * (c₁ * (γ/ω) * (1 - exp(-(γ²/ω) * t)) + exp(-γ*t) * cos(ω*t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The most striking feature of the data is that the system's displacement `x` reaches values (up to 27.68) far exceeding the initial amplitude `A` (max 9.992) and settles around a significant positive mean (8.28). This irrefutably indicates that the oscillation is not centered at the origin but evolves towards a stable, non-zero equilibrium position, `x_eq`.\\n\\nMy theory is built upon a rigorous application of the physics of forced oscillations, combined with a novel hypothesis for the origin of this equilibrium shift. The model begins with the general solution for a damped oscillator moving towards a new equilibrium `x_eq`:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`\\nwhere `x_transient(t)` is the decaying oscillatory part.\\n\\nBy enforcing the physically necessary initial conditions of a system released from rest—an initial displacement `x(0) = A` and an initial velocity `x'(0) = 0`—we can uniquely determine the form of the transient solution. This derivation yields a precise and constrained model for the system's trajectory:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma * t) * [cos(omega * t) + (gamma/omega) * sin(omega * t)]`\\n\\nThis structure is physically robust. It correctly captures the initial state (`x(0) = A`), the final state (`x(t) -> x_eq` as `t -> infinity`), and the phase shift induced by damping, which is mathematically represented by the `sin(omega*t)` term whose coefficient, `gamma/omega`, is fixed by the zero-velocity initial condition.\\n\\nThe central and novel hypothesis of this theory concerns the physical nature of the equilibrium `x_eq`. I posit that the equilibrium shift is not a static property but arises from a **non-linear dynamic rectification effect**. In many physical systems, strong oscillations can induce a steady, DC-like force through complex interactions with a medium or internal non-linearities. This rectified force pushes the oscillator to a new equilibrium.\\n\\nThe efficiency of this rectification process is critically dependent on the system's dynamics, specifically the balance between energy dissipation and oscillation, which is governed by the dimensionless damping ratio, `zeta = gamma / omega`. My theory proposes that this relationship is **non-monotonic**:\\n\\n1.  **Low Damping (`zeta -> 0`):** When damping is negligible, the oscillatory motion is rapid, but the dissipative interaction responsible for the rectification is too weak to generate a significant steady force. The equilibrium shift is minimal.\\n2.  **High Damping (`zeta -> infinity`):** When damping is very strong, the system is overdamped and its motion is a slow, non-oscillatory creep. Without significant oscillatory dynamics, the mechanism for dynamic rectification is suppressed. The equilibrium shift is again minimal.\\n3.  **Intermediate Damping:** The maximum rectification effect occurs at an optimal balance between damping and oscillation, where the system has enough oscillatory motion to power the effect and enough dissipative interaction for it to manifest strongly.\\n\\nThis non-monotonic, peak-like behavior is excellently modeled by the mathematical function `zeta * exp(-zeta)`, which is zero for `zeta=0`, peaks at `zeta=1`, and decays back to zero for large `zeta`. Therefore, I model the final equilibrium position `x_eq` as the sum of a constant baseline offset and this dynamically generated component, scaled by the amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\\n`x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * (gamma/omega) * exp(-gamma/omega))`\\n\\nBy integrating this physically motivated model for the equilibrium state into the rigorously derived equation of motion, we obtain a single, coherent theory that explains all key features of the data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma/omega) * sin(omega * t))\\nwhere x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * (gamma/omega) * exp(-gamma/omega))\\n</final_result>\"}",
