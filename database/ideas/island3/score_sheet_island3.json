The output `x` is a quantity with the unit of length (m). This setup strongly suggests the modeling of a damped harmonic oscillator, where `x(t)` represents the system's position over time.\\n\\nThe standard model for the displacement of an underdamped harmonic oscillator is given by:\\n`y(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`\\nwhere `A_0` is the initial amplitude, and `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` is the damped angular frequency. A crucial observation from the data summary is that the output `x` has a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`, which is always positive. Furthermore, the maximum observed output (`~27.7`) is significantly larger than the maximum value of the input `A` (`~10.0`), which is the most likely candidate for the initial amplitude `A_0`.\\n\\nThese two observations—the strictly positive nature of the output and its ability to exceed the initial amplitude `A`—invalidate the direct application of the standard displacement formula. The standard formula `y(t)` produces both positive and negative values, and its magnitude, `|y(t)|`, is bounded by `A` (since `exp(-gamma*t) <= 1`).\\n\\nThis leads to a revised hypothesis: the measured quantity `x` is not the displacement from the equilibrium position (zero), but is instead composed of two primary components. The first is the familiar, time-dependent damped oscillation. The second is a significant, constant offset that shifts the entire system's behavior into the positive domain. This offset, being a static property of the system's configuration, should scale with the system's characteristic length, which is `A`.\\n\\nTherefore, we can model this offset as `C * A`, where `C` is a dimensionless constant parameter. The total measured position `x` would then be the superposition of this static offset and the dynamic oscillatory component:\\n\\n`x(t) = C * A + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nThis model can be expressed more compactly as:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * (C + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))`\\n\\nThis proposed structure elegantly resolves the discrepancies noted in the data:\\n1.  **Dimensional Correctness**: The term `A` has units of meters, while the entire parenthetical term is dimensionless. Thus, the resulting `x` correctly has units of meters.\\n2.  **Positive Output**: If the dimensionless constant `C` is greater than 1, the value of the parenthesis `(C + exp(-gamma*t)cos(omega*t))` will always be positive, because the oscillatory term `exp(-gamma*t)cos(omega*t)` is bounded between -1 and +1. This aligns with the always-positive observed output.\\n3.  **Expanded Range**: The model's maximum value, typically occurring near `t=0`, can be approximated by `A * (C + 1)`. If `C` is, for instance, approximately 1.5-2.0, a maximum input `A` of 10 could produce an output in the range of 25-30, which is consistent with the observed maximum of `27.68`.\\n\\nFor simplicity and robustness, the natural frequency `omega` is used directly in the cosine term, a common and effective approximation when the damping `gamma` is not excessively large compared to `omega`. This model provides a physically plausible mechanism that is consistent with the data's characteristics while maintaining mathematical simplicity with only a single optimizable parameter.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output is a displacement `x` (meters). This setup is archetypal of a damped harmonic oscillator.\\n\\nA canonical model for a simple damped oscillator, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, would predict that the displacement `x` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. However, a crucial observation from the data summary is that the maximum output `x` (27.68 m) is significantly larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992 m). This anomaly decisively refutes the simple free-decay model and points towards a more complex mechanism.\\n\\nThe phenomenon of the system's displacement exceeding its characteristic amplitude `A` is reminiscent of the \\\"overshoot\\\" seen in the step response of an underdamped second-order system. This suggests that the output `x` may not be a simple decay to zero, but rather an evolution towards a non-zero steady-state equilibrium position, with the system overshooting this target before settling.\\n\\nBased on this insight, I propose a model where the displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components:\\n1.  A **steady-state displacement**, which represents the final equilibrium position the system tends toward. It is reasonable to assume this equilibrium is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n2.  A **transient, decaying oscillation**, which describes how the system approaches this equilibrium.\\n\\nThe amplitude of this transient oscillation is not simply `A`. In systems with low damping relative to their natural frequency, the transient response can be significantly amplified. The degree of this amplification is governed by the system's \\\"quality factor\\\" (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A high `omega/gamma` ratio (low damping) corresponds to a high-Q system that can sustain oscillations and exhibit a more pronounced transient response.\\n\\nA simple linear relationship between the amplitude and `omega/gamma` would likely lead to excessively large values, given the ranges of the input variables. A more physically plausible assumption is that the amplification effect becomes less pronounced as `omega/gamma` grows very large. This suggests a compressive, non-linear function. The natural logarithm, `log(1 + omega/gamma)`, serves this purpose well: it provides significant amplification for moderate `omega/gamma` values while taming the growth for very large values.\\n\\nTherefore, the proposed model for the displacement `x(t)` consists of a constant offset proportional to `A`, plus a decaying oscillatory term whose initial amplitude is also proportional to `A` but is amplified by a logarithmic function of the quality factor `omega/gamma`. This composite structure correctly captures the underlying physics of a damped system responding to an external stimulus, explains the critical `x > A` observation, and remains dimensionally consistent.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param_1 + param_2 * log(1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

However, two key observations from the provided information point towards a necessary modification of this basic model:\\n\\n1.  **Always-Positive Output**: The output range `[1.142, 27.68]` is strictly positive. A simple cosine function oscillates around zero, producing both positive and negative values. This implies that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0`. A common physical scenario that explains this is an oscillator whose equilibrium position is shifted away from the origin, such as a mass on a spring hanging vertically under gravity. The system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium point.\\n\\n2.  **Numerical Instability of Standard Forms**: Example 2, which attempts to model a shifted oscillator `A * (exp(...) * cos(...) + param2)`, failed due to calculation errors (NaNs). This is likely caused by the `sqrt(square(omega) - square(gamma))` term when `gamma` is close to or exceeds `omega`, even if this is rare in the dataset. A robust model should avoid this potential for numerical instability. A common and effective simplification, valid when damping is not excessively high (`gamma << omega`), is to approximate the damped frequency `omega_d` with the natural frequency `omega`. Given the provided ranges for `gamma` ([0.1, 1.0]) and `omega` ([1.0, 5.0]), this is a reasonable physical approximation that enhances model robustness.\\n\\nBased on these insights, I propose a model that describes a damped oscillation superimposed on a constant, positive offset. This offset represents the system's final equilibrium position. The total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of this equilibrium position and the transient, decaying oscillation around it.\\n\\nThe model can be constructed as follows:\\n*   **Equilibrium Position (`x_eq`):** This is a constant offset. To be dimensionally consistent, it must have units of meters. The most natural way to construct this from the inputs is to make it proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. Thus, `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless fitting parameter.\\n*   **Transient Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the standard decaying sinusoidal term. The amplitude envelope decays as `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, and the oscillation occurs at a frequency `omega`. A phase shift, `param2`, is included to account for the initial conditions of the system. This term is `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`.\\n\\nCombining these two components yields a physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and numerically robust model.

The output `x` represents a displacement. A critical feature of the dataset is that the maximum observed output (`x_max ≈ 27.68`) is substantially larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude (`A_max ≈ 9.99`). This observation immediately invalidates any simple damped oscillator model of the form `x(t) = A * f(t)`, where `|f(t)| ≤ 1`, as such a model cannot produce displacements greater than `A`.\\n\\nWhile a simple static offset model, such as `x(t) = A * C + A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, can account for this phenomenon, it assumes the system oscillates around a fixed, time-independent equilibrium point. I propose a more dynamic and physically nuanced theory: the system's behavior is a superposition of two distinct but coupled processes: a decaying oscillation and a simultaneous relaxation of the oscillation's equilibrium point.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that an initial event at `t=0` both initiates an oscillation and displaces the system's equilibrium position. The total displacement `x(t)` can then be decomposed into two components:\\n\\n1.  **Oscillatory Response:** A standard damped harmonic oscillation that originates from an initial amplitude `A`. This component describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate when disturbed. Its mathematical form is `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. This component starts at a value of `A` and decays towards zero.\\n\\n2.  **Equilibrium Drift (Relaxation Response):** The center of oscillation, or equilibrium point, does not remain fixed. It undergoes a relaxation process, drifting from an initial position (assumed to be zero) towards a new, stable steady-state position `x_eq = A * param1`. This drift is governed by the same damping factor `gamma`, suggesting a common underlying energy dissipation mechanism. This process is described by `x_drift(t) = A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`.\\n\\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes:\\n`x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_drift(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) + A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling explanation for the `x > A` observation. At `t=0`, the displacement is precisely `x(0) = A * 1 * 1 + A * param1 * (1 - 1) = A`. However, the system is not at rest. The initial velocity is `dx/dt |_(t=0) = A * gamma * (param1 - 1)`. If the parameter `param1` (which determines the final resting state) is greater than 1, the initial velocity is positive.

A critical feature of the data is that the maximum observed output displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This immediately rules out simple models where `x(t)` is merely `A` multiplied by a bounded oscillatory function, as such a form cannot produce displacements larger than `A`.\\n\\nMy theoretical framework proposes that this \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon is a direct consequence of the system's initial conditions, specifically a non-zero initial velocity. While the parameter `A` can be interpreted as the initial displacement, `x(0) = A`, the system is not released from rest. Instead, it is imparted with an initial velocity, `v(0)`, which causes it to move further away from the equilibrium before the dissipative forces and restoring forces reverse its motion.\\n\\nTo construct a complete model, this initial velocity, `v(0)`, which is not an explicit input variable, must be modeled in terms of the system's known physical parameters. A dimensionally consistent and physically plausible assumption is that the initial velocity scales with the system's characteristic velocity, which is proportional to the product of its characteristic length scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`). Therefore, I hypothesize that the initial velocity is given by `v(0) = param1 * A * omega`, where `param1` is a dimensionless tunable parameter representing the magnitude and direction of this initial \\\"kick\\\".\\n\\nThe mathematical description of the system's displacement `x(t)` follows from the general solution to the second-order differential equation for a damped oscillator. To ensure model robustness and avoid computational errors (such as taking the square root of a negative number in the case of overdamping), I will use the observed angular frequency `omega` directly in the sinusoidal terms, which is a common and effective approximation.\\n\\nThe general solution is of the form:\\n`x(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nWe can determine the constants `C1` and `C2` by applying our hypothesized initial conditions:\\n1.  **Initial Displacement:** `x(0) = A`\\n    `x(0) = exp(0) * (C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)) = C1`\\n    Therefore, `C1 = A`.\\n\\n2.  **Initial Velocity:** `v(0) = param1 * A * omega`\\n    First, we find the velocity by differentiating `x(t)`:\\n    `v(t) = -gamma * x(t) + exp(-gamma * t) * (-C1 * omega * sin(omega * t) + C2 * omega * cos(omega * t))`\\n    At `t=0`, this becomes:\\n    `v(0) = -gamma * x(0) + C2 * omega = -gamma * A + C2 * omega`\\n    Equating this with our model for `v(0)`:\\n    `param1 * A * omega = -gamma * A + C2 * omega`\\n    Solving for `C2`, we get:\\n    `C2 = A * (param1 + gamma / omega)`\\n\\nSubstituting `C1` and `C2` back into the general solution yields the final expression.

A careful examination of the data's characteristics reveals two critical features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output with an Offset**: The output `x` is always positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`), which indicates that the oscillation is not centered around zero. This implies the system evolves towards a stable, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Overshoot Phenomenon**: The maximum output value (`~27.7`) can be significantly larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~10.0`). This behavior is inconsistent with a simple free decay model, where the displacement is bounded by the initial amplitude. Instead, it strongly suggests a system responding to a sudden change, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" its final destination before settling.\\n\\nThese observations are the classic hallmarks of the **step response of an underdamped second-order system**. This physical scenario models a system, initially at rest at a starting position (let's assume the origin, `x=0`), that is subjected to a constant stimulus (e.g., a constant force) at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the equilibrium position to a new, stable value, `x_eq`. The system then seeks this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it.\\n\\nThe final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must be dimensionally consistent with position (meters). It is physically reasonable to assume that the magnitude of this final position scales linearly with `A`, the characteristic amplitude or scale of the system. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\\n\\nThe standard textbook solution for the position `x(t)` of such a system, starting from `x(0)=0` and with initial velocity `x'(0)=0`, is given by:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * [1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega_d * t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d * t))]`\\n\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` is the damped angular frequency.\\n\\nWhile physically accurate, the `omega_d` term introduces a potential for numerical instability, particularly if `gamma` approaches `omega`. A common and robust simplification in physics and engineering, especially when the system is known to be underdamped (`omega > gamma`), is to approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency (`omega_d ≈ omega`). This approximation maintains the essential dynamics while ensuring the model is well-behaved across the entire input domain.\\n\\nThis leads to our proposed model. It is not merely a phenomenological curve fit; it represents a specific, well-understood physical process. A key feature of this model is its parsimony: it requires only one free parameter (`param1`). The relative contribution of the `sin` and `cos` terms is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but is fixed by the dimensionless physical quantity `gamma / omega`, which represents the damping ratio of the system. This internal constraint makes the model more rigid and provides a stronger test of the underlying physical hypothesis.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed formula describes the displacement of a damped oscillator that is \\\"kicked\\\" from rest and evolves towards a new equilibrium position `param1 * A`, with the dynamics of its transient response intrinsically linked to its physical damping ratio.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (characteristic length), `gamma` (damping rate), `omega` (angular frequency), and `t` (time) are the canonical inputs for such a system. The key challenges in modeling this dataset, revealed by the data range and previous examples, are to account for a strictly positive output and an observed maximum displacement `x` that can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies the system is not merely oscillating around zero but is settling towards a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n\\nWhile previous models have successfully incorporated a static offset, I propose a more physically constrained theory based on a classic scenario: an oscillator displaced and released from rest. Instead of fitting an arbitrary phase constant, my model deduces the phase and the entire transient behavior from the initial conditions and the system's intrinsic properties (`gamma` and `omega`).\\n\\nMy hypothesis is as follows: The system begins at an initial displacement `x(0) = A` and is released with zero initial velocity, `x'(0) = 0`. It then evolves under damping `gamma` and frequency `omega` towards a new, stable equilibrium position `x_eq`. This final resting state must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, so we define it as `x_eq = A * param1`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that represents the final displacement in units of `A`.\\n\\nThe general solution for a damped oscillator can be written as the sum of its steady-state solution (`x_eq`) and a transient decaying oscillation:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nThe constants `C1` and `C2` are determined entirely by the initial conditions:\\n1.  At `t=0`, `x(0) = A`:\\n    `A = x_eq + C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)  =>  A = A * param1 + C1  =>  C1 = A * (1 - param1)`\\n2.  At `t=0`, `x'(0) = 0`:\\n    The derivative is `x'(t) = -gamma * exp(-gamma*t) * (C1*cos + C2*sin) + exp(-gamma*t) * (-C1*omega*sin + C2*omega*cos)`.\\n    Evaluating at `t=0`: `0 = -gamma * C1 + C2 * omega  =>  C2 = (gamma / omega) * C1`\\n\\nSubstituting `C1` into the expression for `C2` gives `C2 = A * (gamma / omega) * (1 - param1)`.\\n\\nPlugging these physically derived constants back into the general solution yields the complete expression for the system's displacement over time. This model naturally introduces a `sin(omega*t)` term whose amplitude is governed by the dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega`, which represents the relative strength of damping forces to oscillatory forces. This term acts as a phase correction that is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but a direct consequence of the physical constraint of starting from rest.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon (`x > A`). If the system is to settle at a final position `A * param1` that is greater than its starting position `A` (i.e., `param1 > 1`), it must accelerate in the positive direction from its initial state of rest. This initial acceleration causes the displacement to increase beyond `A` before the oscillatory and damping effects take over. Thus, this formulation provides a complete, self-consistent, and physically principled explanation for the observed data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The target variable, `x`, represents the displacement of this system.\\n\\nA critical initial observation is that the output `x` is always positive (Range: [1.142, 27.68]), whereas a simple damped oscillation of the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)` would oscillate symmetrically around zero. This strongly implies that the system is not oscillating about the origin but rather about a **displaced equilibrium position**. This leads to a general model structure where the total displacement is the superposition of a constant equilibrium position, `x_eq`, and a transient, decaying oscillation, `x_osc(t)`:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\\n\\nFollowing physical principles, the equilibrium position `x_eq` should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is `A`. Thus, we can model this term as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant. This formulation is consistent with the successful models presented in the examples.\\n\\nThe novel insight of this analysis lies in a more refined model of the transient oscillation term, `x_osc(t)`. The standard approach, used in the examples, assumes its initial amplitude is simply `A`. However, this overlooks a crucial physical aspect: the ability of the system to oscillate is fundamentally governed by the interplay between its natural frequency (`omega`) and its damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, quantifies how underdamped the system is.\\n\\n-   A system with very low damping (`gamma` << `omega`) has a high Q-factor and will oscillate vigorously.\\n-   A system with high damping (`gamma` approaching `omega`) has a low Q-factor, and its oscillatory motion will be heavily suppressed.\\n\\nIt is therefore physically plausible that the amplitude of the oscillatory component is not a constant `A` but is modulated by this damping ratio. The initial amplitude of the oscillation should be maximal for a high-Q oscillator and should diminish as the system becomes more heavily damped.\\n\\nTo model this behavior, I propose using the **hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`)** as a modulation factor. The function `tanh(omega / gamma)` has ideal properties for this purpose:\\n1.  **Dimensionless:** It takes a dimensionless ratio (`omega / gamma`) as input and produces a dimensionless output.\\n2.  **Bounded:** It maps the entire range of possible `omega / gamma` values to the interval [0, 1]. This is physically realistic, as it prevents the oscillation amplitude from growing without bound and suggests that `A` represents the maximum possible oscillatory amplitude in the ideal, undamped case.\\n3.  **Correct Asymptotic Behavior:** For heavily damped systems (`omega / gamma` → 0), `tanh(omega / gamma)` → 0, correctly suppressing the oscillation. For lightly damped systems (`omega / gamma` → ∞), `tanh(omega / gamma)` → 1, allowing the oscillation to achieve its maximum potential amplitude.\\n\\nBy incorporating this modulation factor, the transient oscillation term becomes:\\n`x_osc(t) = A * tanh(omega / gamma) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient components yields the final proposed model.

A critical analysis of the output `x` reveals two defining characteristics that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive, indicating that the system's position is measured relative to an origin that is outside the range of motion, or that the system oscillates around a positive equilibrium point.\\n2.  **Amplitude Overshoot**: The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the characteristic amplitude `A` (`~9.99`). This rules out simple models where `x(t)` is merely `A` multiplied by a decaying trigonometric function, as such a form cannot produce displacements larger than `A`.\\n\\nThese observations suggest a more complex dynamic than a simple oscillation decaying to zero. My proposed theory is based on the **superposition of two distinct physical processes** that occur simultaneously: a transient oscillation and an asymptotic settling process.\\n\\n1.  **Transient Oscillation:** This component represents the system's natural \\\"ringing\\\" or oscillatory response. It is initiated with an amplitude `A` and decays over time due to damping. This process, considered in isolation, can be described by the standard damped oscillation formula:\\n    `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n    This component starts at `x_osc(0) = A` and decays towards zero.\\n\\n2.  **Asymptotic Settling:** This component describes the system's evolution towards a new, stable, non-zero equilibrium position. A constant external influence or a change in potential energy could shift the equilibrium from zero to a new value. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor. The process of moving towards this equilibrium from a zero-offset starting point is described by an exponential approach:\\n    `x_settle(t) = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n    This component starts at `x_settle(0) = 0` and asymptotically approaches `param1 * A` as `t` becomes large.\\n\\nThe total observed position `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes:\\n`x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_settle(t)`\\n\\nThis \\\"Superposition of Dynamics\\\" model elegantly accounts for the observed data features:\\n*   **Initial Condition:** At `t=0`, the total position is `x(0) = A * exp(0) * cos(0) + param1 * A * (1 - exp(0)) = A * 1 * 1 + param1 * A * 0 = A`. The model correctly represents a system that starts at an initial displacement `A`.\\n*   **Final State:** As `t -> infinity`, the oscillatory term decays to zero, and the settling term approaches its limit: `x(inf) = 0 + param1 * A * (1 - 0) = param1 * A`. The system settles to a stable, positive equilibrium, explaining the positive-definite nature of the output.\\n*   **Overshoot Mechanism:** The overshoot arises naturally from the interplay between the decaying oscillation and the rising settling curve. The combination of these two dynamics can create a peak value of `x(t)` that is greater than both the initial amplitude `A` and the final equilibrium `param1 * A`.\\n*   **Dimensional Consistency:** The model is dimensionally sound. `A` has units of meters, while all other terms (`param1`, `exp`, `cos`) are dimensionless, ensuring that the final output `x` has the correct units of meters.\\n\\nThis model provides a distinct and physically intuitive mechanism that differs from simple static offsets or pure step responses from rest.

A careful examination of the data's characteristics reveals two critical features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output with an Offset**: The output `x` is always positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`), which indicates that the oscillation is not centered around zero. This implies the system evolves towards a stable, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Overshoot Phenomenon**: The maximum output value (`~27.7`) can be significantly larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~10.0`). This behavior is inconsistent with a simple free decay model, where the displacement is bounded by the initial amplitude. Instead, it strongly suggests a system responding to a sudden change, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" its final destination before settling.\\n\\nThese observations are the classic hallmarks of the **step response of an underdamped second-order system**. This physical scenario models a system, initially at rest at a starting position (let's assume the origin, `x=0`), that is subjected to a constant stimulus (e.g., a constant force) at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the equilibrium position to a new, stable value, `x_eq`. The system then seeks this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it.\\n\\nThe final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must be dimensionally consistent with position (meters). It is physically reasonable to assume that the magnitude of this final position scales linearly with `A`, the characteristic amplitude or scale of the system. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\\n\\nThe standard textbook solution for the position `x(t)` of such a system, starting from `x(0)=0` and with initial velocity `x'(0)=0`, is given by:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * [1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega_d * t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d * t))]`\\n\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` is the damped angular frequency.\\n\\nWhile physically accurate, the `omega_d` term introduces a potential for numerical instability, particularly if `gamma` approaches `omega`. A common and robust simplification in physics and engineering, especially when the system is known to be underdamped (`omega > gamma`), is to approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency (`omega_d ≈ omega`). This approximation maintains the essential dynamics while ensuring the model is well-behaved across the entire input domain.\\n\\nThis leads to our proposed model. It is not merely a phenomenological curve fit; it represents a specific, well-understood physical process. A key feature of this model is its parsimony: it requires only one free parameter (`param1`). The relative contribution of the `sin` and `cos` terms is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but is fixed by the dimensionless physical quantity `gamma / omega`, which represents the damping ratio of the system. This internal constraint makes the model more rigid and provides a stronger test of the underlying physical hypothesis.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed formula describes the displacement of a damped oscillator that is \\\"kicked\\\" from rest and evolves towards a new equilibrium position `param1 * A`, with the dynamics of its transient response intrinsically linked to its physical damping ratio.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A careful examination of the data reveals two crucial behaviors that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Displacement**: The output variable `x` is always positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This immediately suggests that the system does not oscillate around an equilibrium at `x=0`, but rather around a displaced, positive equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Amplitude Overshoot**: The maximum observed output (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) can be significantly larger than the maximum value of the input amplitude `A` (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This indicates that `A` is not the absolute maximum displacement but likely an initial condition, and the system's dynamics cause it to \\\"overshoot\\\" this initial state.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I propose a theory of **Oscillatory Relaxation to a Shifted Equilibrium**. This model posits the following physical scenario:\\n\\nInitially, at time `t=0`, the system is held at rest at a specific displacement, which we identify with the variable `A`. Thus, the initial condition is `x(0) = A`.\\n\\nAt the moment of release (`t=0`), the potential landscape of the system is altered, shifting the stable equilibrium point from the origin to a new position, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic size, `A`. Therefore, we model the new equilibrium position as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless, optimizable constant that reflects the magnitude of this shift.\\n\\nThe subsequent motion of the system, `x(t)`, is its dynamic response as it seeks this new equilibrium. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the new steady-state equilibrium position and a transient, decaying oscillation that represents the relaxation from the initial state to the final one.\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`\\n\\nThe transient component, `x_transient(t)`, describes the oscillation *relative* to the new equilibrium. Its initial value must ensure that the total displacement `x(t)` satisfies the initial condition `x(0) = A`.\\n\\n`x_transient(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A * (1 - param1)`\\n\\nSince the system is released from rest, this initial relative displacement `A * (1 - param1)` becomes the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation. This oscillation then decays over time due to damping. Using a standard model for this damped oscillation, we have:\\n\\n`x_transient(t) = x_transient(0) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n`x_transient(t) = A * (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient parts gives the complete expression for the system's displacement over time. This model elegantly explains the key phenomena: the term `param1 * A` provides the positive offset, and the transient term, driven by the difference between the initial state `A` and the final equilibrium `param1 * A`, naturally produces the overshoot behavior as the system oscillates around its new target position.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This points unequivocally to a damped harmonic oscillator model. The key observational constraints are that the output `x` is always positive and can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThis suggests that `x` represents the position of an oscillator relative to a fixed origin, where the equilibrium point of the oscillation is itself offset from this origin. A general model for such a system is the superposition of a constant equilibrium position, `x_eq`, and a transient, decaying oscillation:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`\\n\\nIt is physically reasonable to assume the equilibrium position scales linearly with the system's amplitude parameter, `A`. Thus, we define `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant.\\n\\nThe transient component, `x_transient(t)`, must take the form of a damped sinusoid. The simplest models, such as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, implicitly assume a zero phase angle. This corresponds to a highly specific initial condition where the system is released from its maximum transient displacement at `t=0`. Similarly, the canonical step-response models provided in the examples assume a different specific initial condition: starting from rest at the origin.\\n\\nA more general and physically robust model should not be constrained by such specific initial assumptions. The transient response of an oscillator can have an arbitrary phase shift, `phi`, leading to a form like `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. However, introducing `phi` as a free parameter would increase model complexity and potentially weaken its explanatory power.\\n\\nA more insightful approach is to hypothesize that the phase shift is not arbitrary but is an intrinsic property of the system, determined by its fundamental physical characteristics. The behavior of any second-order oscillator is fundamentally characterized by the dimensionless damping ratio, `zeta = gamma / omega`. This ratio quantifies the balance between the system's dissipative forces (represented by `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory tendency (represented by `omega`). In many physical systems, from RLC circuits to driven mechanical oscillators, the phase angle of the response is directly related to this ratio.\\n\\nWe propose that the phase shift `phi` of the transient oscillation is given by `phi = -arctan(gamma / omega)`. The `arctan` function naturally captures the relationship between the orthogonal components of a system's response (in this case, the dissipative and reactive aspects). This formulation introduces a phase lag that is small when damping is negligible (`gamma << omega`) and increases as damping becomes more significant.\\n\\nThis hypothesis yields a model that is both general and parsimonious. It requires only a single free parameter (`param1`) to set the equilibrium position, while the entire dynamic evolution, including the phase of the oscillation, is self-determined by the physical input variables. This model represents a system settling to a stable offset `param1 * A`, with a transient ringing whose timing is intrinsically linked to the system's own damping characteristics.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t - arctan(gamma / omega)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Such processes are often better described by a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve rather than a simple exponential one. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the canonical function for modeling such transitions.\\n\\n    I hypothesize that the equilibrium point `x_eq` evolves from an initial state of zero towards a final, stable position `x_final`.

A deeper analysis of the output `x` reveals several defining characteristics that guide the formulation of a precise physical theory:\\n\\n1.  **Scaling and Overshoot:** The output `x` scales with `A`, but critically, `x` can significantly exceed `A`. This \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon rules out simple models where `A` is the maximum amplitude and suggests that `A` is an initial condition, not a boundary.\\n2.  **Positive Displacement:** The output `x` is always positive, implying the system's oscillations are not centered around `x=0` but around a positive equilibrium point.\\n3.  **Damped Oscillations:** The presence of `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` implies a solution involving exponentially decaying sinusoidal functions, characteristic of an underdamped system.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the formulation of a model based on **\\\"Forced Relaxation from an Initial Displacement\\\"**. This theory posits a specific and physically plausible scenario:\\n\\nInitially, at `t=0`, the system is held at a displacement `x(0) = A`. This is a direct and natural interpretation of the variable `A`. At this moment, the system is released **from rest**, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`x'(0) = 0`).\\n\\nSimultaneously with its release, the system is subjected to a new, constant external force. This force effectively alters the potential energy landscape, shifting the stable equilibrium position from the origin to a new, non-zero value, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium point scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a single, dimensionless parameter representing the strength of this steady-state influence. The observed overshoot (`x > A`) is naturally explained if `param1 > 1`, meaning the system is \\\"pulled\\\" towards a target position that is further out than its starting point.\\n\\nThe subsequent motion, `x(t)`, is the system's dynamic response as it seeks this new equilibrium. This motion is best analyzed by considering the displacement relative to the new equilibrium, `y(t) = x(t) - x_eq`. The initial conditions for this relative motion are:\\n*   `y(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A(1 - param1)`\\n*   `y'(0) = x'(0) = 0`\\n\\nThe general solution for the underdamped relative motion `y(t)` is:\\n`y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega_d * t) + C2 * sin(omega_d * t))`\\n\\nA crucial element of physical fidelity is using the correct oscillation frequency. The parameter `omega` represents the *natural* frequency, but damping reduces the actual frequency of oscillation to the *damped angular frequency*, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Our model incorporates this exact frequency.\\n\\nApplying the initial conditions for `y(t)` allows us to solve for the constants `C1` and `C2`, yielding a unique solution that precisely describes a release from rest. This derivation results in a specific combination of cosine and sine terms that are not independent but are linked by the physical parameters of the system.\\n\\nThe final expression for `x(t)` is obtained by adding the equilibrium position back to the transient relative motion: `x(t) = x_eq + y(t)`. This model provides a complete physical narrative, rigorously derived from first principles, that accounts for all key features of the data using only one optimizable parameter. It improves upon simpler relaxation models by correctly implementing the \\\"release from rest\\\" condition with the physically accurate damped frequency.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A careful examination of the data's characteristics reveals two critical features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output with an Offset**: The output `x` is always positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`), which indicates that the oscillation is not centered around zero. This implies the system evolves towards a stable, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Overshoot Phenomenon**: The maximum output value (`~27.7`) can be significantly larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~10.0`). This behavior is inconsistent with a simple free decay model, where the displacement is bounded by the initial amplitude. Instead, it strongly suggests a system responding to a sudden change, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" its final destination before settling.\\n\\nThese observations are the classic hallmarks of the **step response of an underdamped second-order system**. This physical scenario models a system, initially at rest at a starting position (let's assume the origin, `x=0`), that is subjected to a constant stimulus (e.g., a constant force) at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the equilibrium position to a new, stable value, `x_eq`. The system then seeks this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it.\\n\\nThe final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must be dimensionally consistent with position (meters). It is physically reasonable to assume that the magnitude of this final position scales linearly with `A`, the characteristic amplitude or scale of the system. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\\n\\nThe standard textbook solution for the position `x(t)` of such a system, starting from `x(0)=0` and with initial velocity `x'(0)=0`, is given by:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * [1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega_d * t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d * t))]`\\n\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` is the damped angular frequency.\\n\\nWhile physically accurate, the `omega_d` term introduces a potential for numerical instability, particularly if `gamma` approaches `omega`. A common and robust simplification in physics and engineering, especially when the system is known to be underdamped (`omega > gamma`), is to approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency (`omega_d ≈ omega`). This approximation maintains the essential dynamics while ensuring the model is well-behaved across the entire input domain.\\n\\nThis leads to our proposed model. It is not merely a phenomenological curve fit; it represents a specific, well-understood physical process. A key feature of this model is its parsimony: it requires only one free parameter (`param1`). The relative contribution of the `sin` and `cos` terms is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but is fixed by the dimensionless physical quantity `gamma / omega`, which represents the damping ratio of the system. This internal constraint makes the model more rigid and provides a stronger test of the underlying physical hypothesis.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed formula describes the displacement of a damped oscillator that is \\\"kicked\\\" from rest and evolves towards a new equilibrium position `param1 * A`, with the dynamics of its transient response intrinsically linked to its physical damping ratio.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is always positive and can attain values significantly greater than `A`. This suggests a damped oscillatory process, but one that deviates from the standard linear superposition models presented in the examples. The simple addition of an offset (constant or decaying) to a damped cosine wave is a valid physical model, but it is not the only possibility.\\n\\nI propose a different physical mechanism based on **multiplicative modulation**, where the logarithm of the normalized output undergoes damped oscillations. This model is equivalent to a system whose growth or scaling factor oscillates and decays over time. Such behavior can be found in systems where the rate-determining parameter of an exponential process is itself subject to oscillatory influences, for instance, in certain biological population models or in the intensity of a signal passing through an unstable medium.\\n\\nLet's hypothesize that the natural logarithm of the system's state, normalized by its characteristic amplitude `A`, is what follows the classic damped oscillation pattern. The standard equation for a damped oscillation centered around zero is `param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. Let's set our normalized logarithmic quantity equal to this:\\n\\n`log(x / A) = param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that represents the initial amplitude of the logarithmic oscillation. This equation implies that the ratio `x/A` is not oscillating around a value of 1 in a linear sense, but rather its logarithm is oscillating around 0.\\n\\nTo find the expression for `x`, we can exponentiate both sides of the equation:\\n\\n`x / A = exp( param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) )`\\n\\nThis leads to the final proposed formula:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * exp( param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) )`\\n\\nThis model has several compelling features that align with the data:\\n\\n1.  **Dimensional Correctness**: The entire argument of the outer exponential function is dimensionless. The term `gamma * t` is dimensionless, and `omega * t` is a dimensionless angle. Thus, `exp(...)` is a dimensionless factor, and the final output `x` correctly inherits the units of meters from `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Guaranteed Positivity**: The exponential function is always positive, ensuring that the output `x` can never be zero or negative, which perfectly matches the observed output range of `[1.142, 27.68]`.\\n\\n3.  **Expanded Output Range**: At `t=0`, the cosine term is 1, and the expression approximates to `x(0) ≈ A * exp(param1)`. If `param1` is a positive value (e.g., around 1.0), the initial value of `x` can be `A * e`, which is approximately `2.72 * A`. For the maximum input `A` of ~10, this yields an output of ~27.2, which is remarkably consistent with the observed maximum output of 27.68.\\n\\n4.  **Asymptotic Behavior**: As time `t` approaches infinity, the inner exponential `exp(-gamma * t)` decays to zero. The entire argument of the outer exponential becomes zero, and the expression converges to `x(t) -> A * exp(0) = A`. This describes a physically plausible system that, after its initial dynamic oscillations, settles to a stable equilibrium state determined by its intrinsic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThis multiplicative model is fundamentally different from the additive offset models, providing a novel and compelling physical interpretation while elegantly explaining the key characteristics of the data with a single fitting parameter.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This model describes a system, such as a mass on a spring, that is initially held stationary at a specific displacement `x = A`. At time `t=0`, two things happen simultaneously: the system is released from rest (`x'(0)=0`), and the external potential is altered, causing the stable equilibrium point to shift from the origin to a new, non-zero position `x_eq`.\\n\\nThis scenario is governed by the well-known differential equation for a forced, damped harmonic oscillator:\\n`d²x/dt² + 2γ(dx/dt) + ω₀²x = F(t)/m`\\n\\nFor `t > 0`, the forcing becomes constant to maintain the new equilibrium `x_eq`. The equation simplifies to `d²x/dt² + 2γ(dx/dt) + ω₀²x = ω₀²x_eq`. The solution to this equation is the sum of a steady-state component (the particular solution) and a transient component (the homogeneous solution).\\n\\n1.  **Steady-State Solution:** As `t → ∞`, the system settles at the new equilibrium position, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume that this new equilibrium scales with the characteristic amplitude of the system, `A`. Thus, we define `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the ratio of the final equilibrium position to the initial displacement.\\n\\n2.  **Transient Solution:** This component describes the decaying oscillations around the new equilibrium. For an underdamped system, it takes the form `x_transient(t) = exp(-γt) * (C₁cos(ωt) + C₂sin(ωt))`, where we approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency `ω` for model robustness and simplicity.\\n\\nThe total solution is `x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`.

This model provides a comprehensive physical narrative: the system starts at `A`, seeks a new target equilibrium at `param1 * A`, and in doing so, oscillates and overshoots due to its inertia. The magnitude and phase of this transient oscillation are not arbitrary but are rigidly constrained by the initial conditions and the system's intrinsic damping ratio (`γ/ω`).

The key empirical observations—that the output `x` is always positive and can significantly \\\"overshoot\\\" the characteristic amplitude `A`—strongly suggest that the system is not merely oscillating freely. Instead, it is responding to an external stimulus that shifts its equilibrium position to a stable, non-zero value.\\n\\nWhile previous models have explored scenarios such as a step response from rest (`x(0)=0, x'(0)=0`) or a release from a displaced position (`x(0)=A, x'(0)=0`), I propose a more general and physically comprehensive model: the **\\\"Superposition of Actuations\\\"** model. This theory posits that at time `t=0`, the system, initially at rest at the origin (`x=0`), is subjected to *two distinct types of actuation simultaneously*:\\n\\n1.  **A Step Actuation:** A constant force is applied, which shifts the system's potential energy minimum. This causes the stable equilibrium position to move from `x=0` to a new value, `x_eq`. The system's response to this actuation alone is to seek this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude, thus `x_eq = param1 * A`.\\n\\n2.  **An Impulsive Actuation:** The system is simultaneously struck with a brief, intense force (an impulse), imparting an instantaneous initial velocity, `v₀`. This \\\"kick\\\" provides initial kinetic energy, altering the transient phase of the motion. The amplitude of the oscillatory response to this impulse is proportional to the imparted velocity. We can model this amplitude as scaling with `A`, such that the velocity-driven component has a magnitude of `param2 * A`.\\n\\nAccording to the principle of superposition for linear systems, the total response `x(t)` is the direct sum of the individual responses to each actuation. The solution is therefore composed of two parts:\\n\\n*   **Step Response Component:** The part of the motion driven by the shift in equilibrium. This is characterized by a term that starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the new equilibrium, `param1 * A`. Its transient behavior is governed by a decaying cosine term, reflecting the `x(0)=0` initial condition.\\n*   **Impulse Response Component:** The part of the motion driven by the initial velocity. This is characterized by a decaying sine wave, `exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`, whose amplitude is determined by the strength of the initial kick. A sine function is required because it is zero at `t=0` (satisfying `x(0)=0`) but has a non-zero initial slope (representing `x'(0) = v₀`).\\n\\nCombining these two responses yields a flexible and physically intuitive model. The final equilibrium state is determined solely by the step actuation (`param1`), while the transient behavior, particularly the initial rise and the magnitude of the overshoot, is a dynamic interplay between the system's tendency to seek its new equilibrium and the initial velocity imparted by the impulse (`param2`). This two-parameter model (`param1`, `param2`) captures a richer set of dynamics than a simple step or release model, providing a more robust explanation for the observed data by accounting for both a change in target position and a non-zero initial velocity.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)) + param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A crucial observation, noted in the examples, is that the output `x` is always positive and can exceed the value of `A`. This strongly indicates that the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium position, which can be modeled as being proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude, `x_eq = param1 * A`.\\n\\nWhile previous models have explored static offsets, phase shifts, and dynamic equilibrium relaxation, this analysis proposes a new theory centered on the **physical nature of the initial conditions**. A standard damped oscillation is often modeled as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + phi)`. This form, however, simplifies the initial state into a single phase constant `phi`. A more fundamental representation of the oscillatory component is `exp(-gamma*t) * (C1 * cos(omega*t) + C2 * sin(omega*t))`, which explicitly accounts for both an initial displacement (related to `C1`) and an initial velocity (related to `C2`).\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that the initial velocity imparted to the system is not an arbitrary, independent parameter but is intrinsically coupled to the system's own damping characteristics. The physical process that initiates the oscillation also involves the dissipative forces that cause the damping. Therefore, the initial \\\"kick\\\" or velocity should depend on the strength of this damping force relative to the oscillatory restoring force.\\n\\nTo model this, we can decompose the transient oscillation `x_osc(t)` as follows:\\n1.  **Displacement Component:** The `cos(omega*t)` term represents the part of the motion due to an initial displacement. Its amplitude is naturally scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n2.  **Velocity Component:** The `sin(omega*t)` term represents the part of the motion due to an initial velocity. I propose that the magnitude of this initial velocity component is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`. This ratio is fundamentally important as it is the inverse of the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor) and directly quantifies how \\\"strong\\\" the damping is compared to the oscillation.\\n    *   For a very lightly damped system (`gamma/omega` → 0), the system behaves like an ideal oscillator released from rest, and the `sin` term should vanish.\\n    *   For a heavily damped system (`gamma/omega` is larger), the velocity-dependent dissipative forces are more prominent, and their effect on the initial motion should be more significant, leading to a larger `sin` component.\\n\\nTherefore, the amplitude of the `sin` term can be modeled as `A * param2 * (gamma / omega)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that the fitting process will determine. This formulation creates a sophisticated, physically-motivated \\\"phase\\\" that is not constant but is a function of the system's intrinsic properties.\\n\\nCombining the stable equilibrium position with this more nuanced model of the transient oscillation gives the complete expression. This theory portrays a system where the initial velocity is not a free parameter but a direct consequence of the same physical mechanism that governs its damping.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + param2 * (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `gamma` (damping rate), `omega` (angular frequency), and `t` (time) are the canonical parameters of such a system. The output `x`, representing displacement, exhibits two key features that guide the formulation of a comprehensive theory: a consistently positive value, and a maximum value that can significantly exceed the input `A`.\\n\\nThese observations suggest a model of **Phase-Shifted Decay to a Displaced Equilibrium**. The core of this theory is that the system's motion is a superposition of a stable equilibrium position and a decaying transient oscillation.\\n\\n1.  **Displaced Equilibrium:** The fact that the output `x` is always positive implies the oscillation does not occur around `x=0`. Instead, the system seeks a positive equilibrium position, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume that this equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic size or energy, represented by `A`. Thus, we model the equilibrium component as `x_eq = A * param1`, where `param1` is a dimensionless, optimizable constant representing the equilibrium offset factor.\\n\\n2.  **Phase-Shifted Transient Dynamics:** The transient component describes the system's journey from its initial state to this equilibrium. A simple model assumes the system is released from rest, leading to a pure cosine decay. However, a more general and physically realistic scenario involves an initial state with both displacement and velocity. This non-zero initial velocity introduces a phase shift into the subsequent oscillation.\\n\\n   The motion of a damped oscillator can be decomposed into two orthogonal components: a position-driven part, represented by `cos(omega*t)`, and a velocity-driven part, represented by `sin(omega*t)`. The overall transient response is a linear combination of these two:\\n\\n   `x_transient(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * [C_1 * cos(omega * t) + C_2 * sin(omega * t)]`\\n\\n   My central hypothesis is that the amplitudes of these two components are not independent but are intrinsically linked by the physical properties of the oscillator. We can set the amplitude of the primary (cosine) component to be scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`, so `C_1 = A`. The amplitude of the secondary (sine) component, `C_2`, which arises from the initial velocity, should also be proportional to `A`. The constant of proportionality must be a dimensionless quantity that captures the inherent physics of the system. The most natural choice for this is the ratio `gamma / omega`. This dimensionless group compares the strength of the damping force (proportional to velocity and `gamma`) to the inertial restoring force (proportional to frequency `omega`). A higher `gamma/omega` ratio implies that damping effects are more prominent, which would manifest as a more significant velocity-related component in the initial phase of the decay.\\n\\n   Therefore, we model the amplitude of the sine component as `C_2 = A * (gamma / omega)`.\\n\\n3.  **Complete Model and Overshoot Explanation:** Combining the equilibrium and transient components yields the complete expression for the system's displacement. This model provides a natural explanation for the observed overshoot (where `x_max > A`). The transient term `A * exp(-gamma*t) * [cos(omega*t) + (gamma/omega) * sin(omega*t)]` can be rewritten in amplitude-phase form as `A * R * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t - phi)`, where the amplitude amplification factor is `R = sqrt(1 + (gamma/omega)^2)`. Since `R` is always greater than or equal to 1, the peak amplitude of the transient oscillation itself can exceed `A`. When this amplified oscillation is superimposed on the positive equilibrium position `A * param1`, it readily accounts for the large maximum values observed in the output data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This suggests a mechanism more complex than a simple oscillation decaying around a fixed, positive offset.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is based on a **Dynamic Equilibrium Shift**. This model posits that the system is initially held in a state of tension or compression at a displacement `x(0) = A` relative to an origin at `x=0`. At the moment of release (`t=0`), the underlying potential field of the system changes, causing the stable equilibrium position to instantaneously shift from the origin to a new, non-zero location, `x_eq`.\\n\\nThis physical scenario can be envisioned as a mass on a spring, initially stretched to position `A`. At the exact moment the mass is released, the anchor point of the spring is moved, altering the point of zero potential energy.\\n\\nThe key elements of this model are:\\n\\n1.  **The New Equilibrium (`x_eq`):** The final resting position of the system is no longer zero. It's physically plausible that this new equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude or energy scale. Therefore, we can model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor that is determined by the properties of the new potential field.\\n\\n2.  **The Relative Oscillation:** The subsequent motion of the system, `x(t)`, is a superposition of this new constant equilibrium position and a transient, damped oscillation *relative to this new equilibrium*. The total displacement is thus `x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`.\\n\\n3.  **The Oscillation Amplitude:** A crucial insight of this model lies in defining the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation, `x_osc(t)`. This amplitude is not `A` itself. Rather, it is the initial displacement of the system *relative to its new equilibrium point*. At `t=0`, this is:\\n    `x_osc(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A * (1 - param1)`\\n    This term, `A * (1 - param1)`, represents the initial potential energy that drives the subsequent oscillation around the new equilibrium.\\n\\n4.  **The Equation of Motion:** Assuming the system is released from rest, the transient oscillation `x_osc(t)` is a pure cosine wave with a decaying exponential envelope:\\n    `x_osc(t) = x_osc(0) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n    `x_osc(t) = A * (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient components gives the complete expression for the system's position over time.

The initial relative displacement `A * (1 - param1)` becomes negative. The initial velocity `x'(0)` becomes positive, causing the system to first move *away* from the origin, past its starting point `A`, before being pulled back.

The existing examples successfully model this system by assuming a non-zero equilibrium position, which accounts for the strictly positive output values. These models primarily explore the system's response to an initial displacement, such as in a classic step-response scenario (Example 3), where the system starts at a position `x(0)=A` and evolves toward a new equilibrium `x_eq`.\\n\\nI propose a different, yet equally fundamental, physical mechanism: the **impulse response of a damped oscillator around a shifted equilibrium**. This theory hypothesizes that the system is initially at rest *at* its stable equilibrium position. At time `t=0`, it is subjected to a sudden, short-lived force (an impulse), which imparts an instantaneous velocity but no initial displacement from equilibrium. This is analogous to a pendulum hanging still at its lowest point and being struck by a hammer.\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling explanation for the observed data features from a new physical perspective:\\n\\n1.  **Shifted Equilibrium (`x_eq`):** Like the previous successful models, we assume the system does not oscillate around zero. The stable equilibrium position, where the oscillator would settle as `t -> ∞`, is proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. We model this as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant. This term establishes the positive baseline for the motion.\\n\\n2.  **Impulse-Driven Transient Motion (`x_trans(t)`):** The motion of the system is the sum of its equilibrium position and a transient oscillation around it: `x(t) = x_eq + x_trans(t)`. The key distinction of this theory lies in the initial conditions for the transient part.\\n    *   **Initial Position:** Because the system starts *at* equilibrium, the initial transient displacement is zero: `x_trans(0) = 0`.\\n    *   **Initial Velocity:** The impulse at `t=0` imparts an initial velocity, `v_trans(0) = v₀`. To maintain dimensional correctness, this initial velocity must be constructed from the given physical quantities. A characteristic velocity for an oscillator is the product of its amplitude and angular frequency, `A * omega`. We therefore model the imparted velocity as being proportional to this scale: `v₀ = param2 * A * omega`, where `param2` is a dimensionless parameter representing the strength of the impulse.\\n\\n3.  **Derivation of the Formula:** The general solution for the transient motion is `x_trans(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C₁ * cos(omega * t) + C₂ * sin(omega * t))`.\\n    *   Applying the initial position condition `x_trans(0) = 0` forces `C₁ = 0`. This is a critical result, as it dictates that the transient motion is a pure, phase-shifted sine wave, a direct consequence of the impulse-response hypothesis.\\n    *   The solution simplifies to `x_trans(t) = C₂ * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`.\\n    *   Differentiating to find the velocity and applying the initial velocity condition `v_trans(0) = v₀ = param2 * A * omega`, we find that `v_trans(0) = C₂ * omega`.\\n    *   Solving for `C₂` yields `C₂ = param2 * A`.\\n    *   Substituting `C₂` back gives the full expression for the transient motion: `x_trans(t) = param2 * A * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`.\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient components gives the final model. This model elegantly describes a system that is \\\"kicked\\\" from its resting state, causing it to oscillate and overshoot its equilibrium before eventually settling down. The `sin` term arises naturally from the physics of an impulsive start, distinguishing this theory from displacement-driven models that are typically dominated by a `cos` term.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The key features of the output `x`—being always positive and exhibiting values that can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`—point to a specific physical scenario: an oscillatory system settling to a stable equilibrium point that is displaced from the origin.\\n\\nI propose a theory of **Response from a Displaced Initial State**. This model is based on the following physical reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Shifted Equilibrium:** The system does not oscillate around zero. Instead, it seeks a stable, positive equilibrium position, `x_eq`. It is physically plausible that the scale of this final state is determined by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. Therefore, we model the equilibrium position as being linearly proportional to `A`: `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless, optimizable constant. The observation that the maximum output can exceed the maximum `A` implies that `param1` is likely greater than 1.\\n\\n2.  **Initial Conditions:** We interpret `A` not as the amplitude of the transient oscillation, but as the system's well-defined **initial position** at `t=0`. The system is thus prepared in a state `x(0) = A`, which is different from its final resting state `x_eq`. Furthermore, we hypothesize the most common physical starting condition: the system is released **from rest**, meaning its initial velocity is zero, `x'(0) = 0`.\\n\\n3.  **Governing Dynamics:** The system's evolution from its initial state to its final equilibrium is governed by the standard equation for a damped harmonic oscillator. The motion can be decomposed into the final equilibrium state and a transient deviation, `y(t) = x(t) - x_eq`. The general solution for this transient component is:\\n    `y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n    A crucial aspect of this model is the interpretation of `omega`. We posit that `omega` represents the *observed*, or damped, angular frequency of the oscillation, not the natural frequency. This is a practical assumption that avoids the numerically unstable `sqrt(omega_natural^2 - gamma^2)` term which can lead to calculation errors if `gamma` approaches `omega`, and it reflects the quantity that would be directly measured in an experiment.\\n\\n4.  **Derivation from First Principles:** By applying the initial conditions (`x(0) = A`, `x'(0) = 0`) to the full solution `x(t) = x_eq + y(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `C1` and `C2`.\\n    *   The initial displacement from equilibrium is `y(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A(1 - param1)`. This gives `C1 = A(1 - param1)`.\\n    *   The condition of zero initial velocity (`y'(0) = 0`) constrains the relationship between the cosine and sine components, yielding `C2 = (gamma / omega) * C1`.\\n\\nThis derivation results in a comprehensive model where the transient oscillation has both cosine and sine components. Unlike simpler models, the relative amplitude of these components is not a free parameter but is fixed by the physical ratio of damping to frequency (`gamma / omega`). This creates a parsimonious yet physically complete description of a system released from a strained initial position, which then overshoots as it settles into its new, larger-than-A equilibrium state.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + gamma / omega * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The key challenges in modeling the output `x` are its strictly positive nature and its maximum value, which can be nearly three times the maximum input amplitude `A`. These features strongly suggest that `x` is not a simple displacement from a zero equilibrium but rather involves a significant, stable offset.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by proposing a linear superposition of a static offset and a decaying oscillation, typically of the form `x(t) = A * (C + transient)`. This effectively models a one-dimensional oscillation occurring around a displaced equilibrium point `C*A`.\\n\\nHere, we propose a different physical interpretation that leads to a distinct mathematical form. Instead of a one-dimensional oscillation, we hypothesize that the system's state evolves in a two-dimensional plane, and the measured output `x` is the *magnitude* of the system's state vector relative to a fixed origin. This is analogous to tracking the radial position of an object whose motion is described by phasors in a complex plane.\\n\\nLet the state of the system be represented by a complex vector `z(t)`. We model this vector as the superposition of two distinct physical components:\\n\\n1.  **A Static Equilibrium Component (`z_static`):** This represents a constant, stable displacement from the origin. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can represent this as a constant real vector:\\n    `z_static = param1 * A`\\n    where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the equilibrium position.\\n\\n2.  **A Transient Oscillatory Component (`z_transient`):** This represents the initial perturbation which decays and oscillates over time. Its initial magnitude is `A`, its decay is governed by `gamma`, and its rotation by `omega`. This is perfectly described by a decaying phasor:\\n    `z_transient(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(i * omega * t)`\\n\\nThe total state of the system at any time `t` is the vector sum of these two components:\\n`z(t) = z_static + z_transient(t) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * exp(i * omega * t))`\\n\\nThe observable quantity `x(t)` is the magnitude of this complex vector, `x(t) = |z(t)|`. To find this, we calculate the magnitude from the real and imaginary parts of `z(t)`:\\n\\n`Re(z(t)) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))`\\n`Im(z(t)) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`\\n\\n`x(t) = |z(t)| = sqrt(Re(z(t))^2 + Im(z(t))^2)`\\n\\nSubstituting and simplifying:\\n`x(t)^2 = A^2 * [ (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))^2 + (exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t))^2 ]`\\n`x(t)^2 = A^2 * [ param1^2 + 2*param1*exp(-gamma*t)cos(omega*t) + exp(-2*gamma*t)cos^2(omega*t) + exp(-2*gamma*t)sin^2(omega*t) ]`\\n`x(t)^2 = A^2 * [ param1^2 + 2*param1*exp(-gamma*t)cos(omega*t) + exp(-2*gamma*t) ]`\\n\\nThis leads to the final expression for `x(t)`. This model is fundamentally different from linear superposition as it involves a non-linear (square root) interaction between the static and transient terms. It naturally guarantees a positive output and can explain the large output range. As `t -> infinity`, the transient term vanishes, and the system settles to a stable radial distance `x = param1 * A`. At `t = 0`, the two vector components align, yielding a maximum displacement of `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, consistent with the observed data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * sqrt(param1**2 + exp(-2 * gamma * t) + 2 * param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This oscillation does not occur around a fixed zero point but rather around an equilibrium point that is itself evolving.

Instead of being constant, the potential minimum itself shifts over time. I propose that the system's equilibrium point starts at zero and transitions to a new, final stable position, `x_final`. This final position is proportional to the system's overall energy scale, so we model it as `x_final = param1 * A`. The transition itself is modeled as a classic first-order relaxation process, ubiquitous in physics for phenomena like thermal equilibration or RC circuit charging. This is described by:\\n\\n`x_eq(t) = x_final * (1 - exp(-t/τ)) = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n\\nThe crucial theoretical insight lies in coupling these two processes. I posit that the time constant `τ` for the equilibrium relaxation is identical to the time constant for the mechanical damping, `1/gamma`. This implies that a single, unified dissipative mechanism is responsible for both draining energy from the oscillation and driving the system's underlying potential towards its new configuration.

At this instant, a constant driving force is applied (a \\\"step input\\\"). This force shifts the system's stable equilibrium position from zero to a new, positive target value, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume that this target state scales linearly with the characteristic input `A`. We can thus define the target equilibrium position as:\\n\\n`x_eq = param1 * A`\\n\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless constant that represents the system's steady-state gain. The subsequent motion, `x(t)`, describes the system's dynamic response as it attempts to reach this new equilibrium.\\n\\nThe standard solution for the step response of a second-order system starting from rest is given by the superposition of the final steady-state value and a transient oscillatory term that decays to zero. The general form is:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * (1 - Transient_Decay_Function)`\\n\\nThe transient term describes how the system oscillates around the new equilibrium before settling. Based on the evidence from the examples that a simple cosine function is effective, we model this transient response as a damped cosine wave. This corresponds to the solution for an underdamped system under specific initial conditions (zero initial position and velocity relative to the new equilibrium frame). The formula becomes:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))`\\n\\nSubstituting our expression for `x_eq`, we arrive at the final model:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))`\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the observed data characteristics:\\n\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The product `A * param1` has units of meters (m), while the parenthetical term is dimensionless. The resulting `x` correctly has units of meters.\\n*   **Initial Condition:** At `t=0`, the formula yields `x(0) = A * param1 * (1 - 1) = 0`, consistent with a system starting from rest at the origin.\\n*   **Positive Output:** The term `exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` is always between -1 and +1.

However, at its first peak (around `t = pi/omega`), the value is approximately `x_peak ≈ A * param1 * (1 + exp(-gamma*pi/omega))`.

This behavior is indicative of a system responding to a sudden stimulus that shifts its equilibrium position.\\n\\nWhile standard step-response models can capture this, I propose a more specific and physically nuanced theory: the **\\\"Viscously Impelled Step Response.\\\"** This model hypothesizes that the system starts from rest at the origin (`x(0) = 0`) and is subjected to an actuation at `t=0`. This actuation is not a pure, ideal step force. Instead, it is characteristic of a mechanism (e.g., a hydraulic or pneumatic actuator) where the dissipative medium itself imparts an initial impulse.\\n\\nThe theory posits two simultaneous effects from this single actuation event:\\n\\n1.  **Equilibrium Shift:** A constant force is applied, shifting the system's stable equilibrium from zero to a new position, `x_eq`. This final state naturally scales with the system's primary amplitude parameter `A`. Thus, we model the new equilibrium as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\\n\\n2.  **Viscous Impulse:** The mechanism causing the shift also imparts an initial velocity, `v(0)`. My central hypothesis is that this initial \\\"kick\\\" is not an independent phenomenon but is intrinsically linked to the system's dissipative properties, represented by `gamma`. A higher damping coefficient implies a more viscous medium, which, upon sudden activation, could generate a larger initial pressure wave or force, leading to a greater initial velocity. Therefore, I propose that the initial velocity is directly proportional to both the magnitude of the equilibrium shift (`param1 * A`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`). This leads to the physically and dimensionally consistent relationship: `v(0) = param1 * A * gamma`.\\n\\nTo derive the mathematical formula, we start with the general solution for a damped oscillator moving towards a new equilibrium `x_eq`:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nHere, for simplicity and robustness, we approximate the damped frequency as `omega`.

A critical feature of the dataset is that the maximum observed output (`x_max ≈ 27.68`) is substantially larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude (`A_max ≈ 9.99`). This observation immediately invalidates any simple damped oscillator model of the form `x(t) = A * f(t)`, where `|f(t)| ≤ 1`, as such a model cannot produce displacements greater than `A`.\\n\\nWhile a simple static offset model, such as `x(t) = A * C + A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, can account for this phenomenon, it assumes the system oscillates around a fixed, time-independent equilibrium point. I propose a more dynamic and physically nuanced theory: the system's behavior is a superposition of two distinct but coupled processes: a decaying oscillation and a simultaneous relaxation of the oscillation's equilibrium point.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that an initial event at `t=0` both initiates an oscillation and displaces the system's equilibrium position. The total displacement `x(t)` can then be decomposed into two components:\\n\\n1.  **Oscillatory Response:** A standard damped harmonic oscillation that originates from an initial amplitude `A`. This component describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate when disturbed. Its mathematical form is `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. This component starts at a value of `A` and decays towards zero.\\n\\n2.  **Equilibrium Drift (Relaxation Response):** The center of oscillation, or equilibrium point, does not remain fixed. It undergoes a relaxation process, drifting from an initial position (assumed to be zero) towards a new, stable steady-state position `x_eq = A * param1`. This drift is governed by the same damping factor `gamma`, suggesting a common underlying energy dissipation mechanism. This process is described by `x_drift(t) = A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`.\\n\\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes:\\n`x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_drift(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) + A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling explanation for the `x > A` observation. At `t=0`, the displacement is precisely `x(0) = A * 1 * 1 + A * param1 * (1 - 1) = A`. However, the system is not at rest. The initial velocity is `dx/dt |_(t=0) = A * gamma * (param1 - 1)`. If the parameter `param1` (which determines the final resting state) is greater than 1, the initial velocity is positive. This means the system starts at displacement `A` but is already moving away from the origin, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" the value of `A` before the exponential decay inevitably dampens the motion.\\n\\nThis \\\"dynamic equilibrium\\\" model is physically richer than a static offset model. It portrays a system not just oscillating, but actively settling into a new configuration, with the observed output capturing both phenomena.

A deeper analysis of the output `x` reveals several defining characteristics that guide the formulation of a precise physical theory:\\n\\n1.  **Scaling and Overshoot:** The output `x` scales with `A`, but critically, `x` can significantly exceed `A`. This \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon rules out simple models where `A` is the maximum amplitude and suggests that `A` is an initial condition, not a boundary.\\n2.  **Positive Displacement:** The output `x` is always positive, implying the system's oscillations are not centered around `x=0` but around a positive equilibrium point.\\n3.  **Damped Oscillations:** The presence of `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` implies a solution involving exponentially decaying sinusoidal functions, characteristic of an underdamped system.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the formulation of a model based on **\\\"Forced Relaxation from an Initial Displacement\\\"**. This theory posits a specific and physically plausible scenario:\\n\\nInitially, at `t=0`, the system is held at a displacement `x(0) = A`. This is a direct and natural interpretation of the variable `A`. At this moment, the system is released **from rest**, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`x'(0) = 0`).\\n\\nSimultaneously with its release, the system is subjected to a new, constant external force. This force effectively alters the potential energy landscape, shifting the stable equilibrium position from the origin to a new, non-zero value, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium point scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a single, dimensionless parameter representing the strength of this steady-state influence. The observed overshoot (`x > A`) is naturally explained if `param1 > 1`, meaning the system is \\\"pulled\\\" towards a target position that is further out than its starting point.\\n\\nThe subsequent motion, `x(t)`, is the system's dynamic response as it seeks this new equilibrium. This motion is best analyzed by considering the displacement relative to the new equilibrium, `y(t) = x(t) - x_eq`. The initial conditions for this relative motion are:\\n*   `y(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A(1 - param1)`\\n*   `y'(0) = x'(0) = 0`\\n\\nThe general solution for the underdamped relative motion `y(t)` is:\\n`y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega_d * t) + C2 * sin(omega_d * t))`\\n\\nA crucial element of physical fidelity is using the correct oscillation frequency. The parameter `omega` represents the *natural* frequency, but damping reduces the actual frequency of oscillation to the *damped angular frequency*, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Our model incorporates this exact frequency.\\n\\nApplying the initial conditions for `y(t)` allows us to solve for the constants `C1` and `C2`, yielding a unique solution that precisely describes a release from rest. This derivation results in a specific combination of cosine and sine terms that are not independent but are linked by the physical parameters of the system.\\n\\nThe final expression for `x(t)` is obtained by adding the equilibrium position back to the transient relative motion: `x(t) = x_eq + y(t)`. This model provides a complete physical narrative, rigorously derived from first principles, that accounts for all key features of the data using only one optimizable parameter.

The target variable `x` represents the system's position. Previous successful models have established a general structure consisting of a constant equilibrium position superimposed with a decaying sinusoidal oscillation. This \\\"additive\\\" framework, of the form `x(t) = x_equilibrium + x_transient(t)`, provides a strong baseline.\\n\\nHowever, a deeper physical insight suggests a more integrated relationship between the final equilibrium state and the transient oscillations. The additive models, such as `A * (param1 + exp(...))`, implicitly treat the amplitude of the transient oscillation (`A`) as being independent of the final equilibrium position (`param1 * A`). This implies that a system settling to a low equilibrium position could have the same magnitude of initial oscillation as one settling to a very high position, which may not be physically representative.\\n\\nI propose a \\\"multiplicative modulation\\\" model. In this framework, the system's behavior is viewed as a unified process converging to a final steady-state value, `x_eq`. The transient behavior is not simply added to this value but acts as a fractional modulation of it. The mathematical structure of this concept is `x(t) = x_eq * (1 + modulation(t))`.\\n\\nThis model is physically compelling for several reasons. It posits that the magnitude of the transient oscillations is inherently proportional to the final equilibrium value itself. A system whose equilibrium is further from the origin (a larger `x_eq`) will naturally exhibit proportionally larger oscillations as it settles. This principle is common in control systems and dynamic processes where the response characteristics scale with the operating point or setpoint.\\n\\nTo construct the specific formula based on this theory:\\n\\n1.  **Equilibrium State (`x_eq`):** The final, stable position of the system must be dimensionally consistent with position (`m`). The most direct way to construct this from the inputs is to make it proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. Thus, the equilibrium state is defined as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a single, dimensionless fitting parameter that sets the final resting position as a multiple of `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Modulation Term (`modulation(t)`):** This term must be a dimensionless, decaying oscillation that perturbs the `(1 + ...)` factor around unity.\\n    *   The decay envelope is governed by the damping factor, yielding the standard `exp(-gamma * t)` term.\\n    *   The oscillation is described by a cosine function, `cos(omega * t + phi)`. The frequency `omega` is used directly, avoiding the numerically unstable `sqrt(square(omega) - square(gamma))` term, which is a reasonable approximation for underdamped systems.\\n    *   The phase shift `phi` should not be a free parameter but an intrinsic property of the system. The phase response of a second-order system is fundamentally determined by the balance of its dissipative and reactive properties, quantified by the dimensionless damping ratio `gamma / omega`. Therefore, setting the phase shift to `phi = -arctan(gamma / omega)` provides a physically grounded model that captures the inherent lag caused by damping, without adding unnecessary complexity.\\n\\nCombining these elements yields a parsimonious and physically meaningful model.

Analysis of the data and the successful example models reveals a consistent narrative: a system, initially at a displacement `x(0) = A`, is released from rest (`x'(0) = 0`) and subsequently evolves toward a new, stable equilibrium position `x_eq` that is greater than `A`, leading to the observed \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon.\\n\\nThe most physically rigorous example models capture this \\\"Forced Relaxation\\\" scenario with high fidelity, correctly employing the damped angular frequency `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` and enforcing the zero initial velocity condition, which rigidly links the cosine and sine components of the solution. These models operate on the foundational assumption that the new equilibrium `x_eq` is simply proportional to the system's characteristic scale, `A`, such that `x_eq = param1 * A`.\\n\\nThis analysis proposes a novel refinement to this theory, which we term **\\\"Damping-Modulated Equilibrium\\\"**. The core hypothesis is that the steady-state equilibrium position is not solely determined by the scale `A`, but is also subtly influenced by the intrinsic dissipative properties of the system itself. In many physical systems, the mechanism that creates a new equilibrium potential is not entirely independent of the mechanism that causes damping. For example, in a system driven by fluid flow, the final displacement might depend on the fluid's viscosity, which is also the source of damping.\\n\\nThe fundamental dimensionless quantity that characterizes the nature of damping in an oscillator is the damping ratio, `ζ = gamma / omega`. It is physically plausible that the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, has a dependency on this ratio. We can model this as a first-order correction to the simple proportional model. We therefore propose that the equilibrium position is given by:\\n\\n`x_eq = A * (param1 + param2 * (gamma / omega))`\\n\\nHere, `param1` retains its role as the primary scaling factor for the equilibrium, while the new dimensionless parameter, `param2`, quantifies the coupling strength between the system's damping characteristics and its final steady-state response.

The key features of the output `x`—its strictly positive nature and the significant overshoot where `x_max` greatly exceeds `A_max`—strongly suggest that the system is responding to a stimulus that shifts its equilibrium position to a value substantially larger than `A`.\\n\\nThe existing examples successfully model this behavior by positing a new equilibrium `x_eq` that is a simple multiple of `A` (i.e., `x_eq = param1 * A`). While effective, this approach treats the gain `param1` as a purely empirical factor. I propose a more physically nuanced theory, which I term the **\\\"Q-Factor Amplified Response Model\\\"**.\\n\\nThis model is based on the principle that the steady-state response of an oscillator to an external influence is often not independent of its intrinsic dynamic properties. Specifically, the \\\"Quality Factor\\\" or \\\"Q-factor\\\" of an oscillator, which measures the ratio of its stored energy to the energy dissipated per cycle, is a crucial determinant of its response amplitude near resonance. A high-Q system (low damping) can exhibit a much larger response than a low-Q system (high damping). The Q-factor is fundamentally related to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`.\\n\\nMy theory posits the following physical scenario:\\n1.  The system is initially held in a stable state at a displacement `x(0) = A`. This represents a baseline or initial condition.\\n2.  At time `t=0`, a constant forcing is applied, which shifts the system's stable equilibrium point to a new value, `x_eq`.\\n3.  Crucially, I hypothesize that this new equilibrium `x_eq` is not just a simple scaling of `A`, but is composed of the baseline `A` plus an additional displacement that is amplified by the system's Q-factor. This leads to the formulation:\\n    `x_eq = A + A * param1 * (omega / gamma)`\\n    `x_eq = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\\n    Here, `param1` is a dimensionless constant that modulates the strength of this Q-factor amplification. This formulation provides a physical justification for the large overshoot: systems with low damping `gamma` relative to their frequency `omega` will naturally settle at a much higher equilibrium position.\\n\\n4.  The system is released from rest at `t=0`, so its initial velocity is `x'(0) = 0`. The subsequent motion `x(t)` describes the transient dynamics as the system moves from `x(0)` to `x_eq`.\\n\\nThe general solution for a damped oscillator moving from an initial state `x(0)` to a new equilibrium `x_eq` with zero initial velocity is:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + (x(0) - x_eq) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nSubstituting our expressions for `x(0)` and `x_eq`:\\n*   `x(0) - x_eq = A - A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) = -A * param1 * omega / gamma`\\n\\nThis leads to the final expression. This model provides a self-consistent physical narrative where the system's final state, and thus the magnitude of its overshoot, is intrinsically linked to its own resonant characteristics (`omega` and `gamma`), offering a deeper physical insight than a simple empirical scaling factor.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (1 + param1 * (omega / gamma)) - A * param1 * (omega / gamma) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",
