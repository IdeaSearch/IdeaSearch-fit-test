The independent variables represent the core components of such a system: `A` serves as a characteristic length scale or amplitude (meters), `gamma` as a damping coefficient (s⁻¹), `omega` as a natural angular frequency (s⁻¹), and `t` as the elapsed time (s). The target variable `x` is a resulting quantity measured in meters.\\n\\nA standard model for the displacement of a damped oscillator, `x(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ω't + φ)`, fails to capture two crucial features observed in the data. Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input `A` (e.g., max output of ~27.7 vs max `A` of ~10.0), indicating a strong amplification mechanism not present in the simple model. Secondly, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple displacement should oscillate between positive and negative values.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the theory that `x` does not represent the instantaneous displacement, but rather a related positive-definite quantity, like an effective amplitude or envelope, which is subject to significant amplification based on the system's intrinsic properties.\\n\\nThe core of this theoretical analysis lies in the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. In physics, this ratio is directly related to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of an oscillator, a measure of how underdamped it is. A large `omega / gamma` ratio signifies a high-Q system, one that oscillates many times before decaying and can exhibit a very strong resonant response. I hypothesize that this resonant behavior is the source of the observed amplification.\\n\\nMy proposed model posits that the effective amplitude `x` is determined by three interacting physical effects:\\n1.  **Base Amplitude Scaling:** The variable `A` sets the fundamental scale of the system's response.\\n2.  **Resonant Amplification:** The system's amplitude is exponentially amplified by its Q-factor, modeled by the term `exp(param_1 * omega / gamma)`. This exponential relationship explains the powerful amplification, where a high-Q system (`omega >> gamma`) yields a disproportionately large response.\\n3.  **Temporal Damping:** This amplified response then decays exponentially over time, as expected in any dissipative system. This is captured by the classic damping term `exp(-param_2 * gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThis unified model elegantly explains both the amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (as the exponential function always yields a positive result). It is dimensionally consistent and provides a coherent physical narrative for the underlying mechanism.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param_1 * omega / gamma - param_2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables correspond directly to the canonical parameters of such a system: `A` (amplitude, dimension of length [m]), `gamma` (damping coefficient, [s⁻¹]), `omega` (angular frequency, [s⁻¹]), and `t` (time, [s]). The target variable `x` (position, [m]) represents the state of this oscillator at a given time.\\n\\nA key feature of the dataset is that the output `x` is always positive, whereas a standard oscillatory function like cosine or sine produces both positive and negative values. This implies that we are not observing a simple oscillation around a zero equilibrium. Instead, two main physical interpretations are plausible:\\n1.  The quantity `x` represents the *magnitude* of the displacement, i.e., `abs(...)`.\\n2.  The oscillation occurs around a positive equilibrium point, meaning a significant DC offset is present in the system's position.\\n\\nThe second interpretation is often more physically representative, describing a system oscillating around a stable, non-zero baseline. We can model this baseline as being proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. The total position `x` would then be the sum of this baseline position and the time-varying oscillatory displacement from that baseline.\\n\\nThe standard model for an underdamped oscillator's displacement from equilibrium is an exponentially decaying sinusoidal function. The amplitude of this oscillation decays as `exp(-gamma * t)`. The frequency of the oscillation is not the natural frequency `omega`, but the damped angular frequency `omega_d`, which is correctly calculated as `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`. The ranges of `omega` and `gamma` provided indicate that the system is in the underdamped regime (`omega > gamma`), so this formulation is physically appropriate.\\n\\nCombining these insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The position `x` is the sum of a static offset proportional to `A` and a damped oscillatory term. The amplitude of the oscillation is also proportional to `A`, its decay is governed by `exp(-gamma * t)`, and its frequency is the damped frequency `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`. To allow for empirical fitting, we introduce dimensionless parameters (`param1`, `param2`, `param3`) to scale the offset, the damping rate, and the frequency, respectively. This provides the necessary flexibility to match the experimental data while retaining a strong physical foundation.\\n\\nThe resulting formula is dimensionally consistent: `A` (in meters) scales a completely dimensionless term composed of the offset and the `exp * cos` function. The arguments of the exponential (`gamma * t`) and the cosine (`sqrt(omega² - gamma²) * t`) are correctly dimensionless, ensuring the mathematical and physical validity of the expression.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>x = A * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t))</final_result>\"}",

This offset, being a static property of the system's configuration, should scale with the system's characteristic length, which is `A`.\\n\\nTherefore, we can model this offset as `C * A`, where `C` is a dimensionless constant parameter.

This aligns with the always-positive observed output.\\n3.  **Expanded Range**: The model's maximum value, typically occurring near `t=0`, can be approximated by `A * (C + 1)`.

A preliminary analysis of the variable roles and units strongly suggests a process related to damped oscillations.\\n\\nA key challenge in modeling this data is that the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, and the output is always positive. A standard damped oscillator model, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, cannot account for this, as its magnitude is always less than or equal to `A` and its value can be negative.\\n\\nThis leads to the hypothesis that the underlying mechanism is more complex than a simple linear oscillator. The relationship between the oscillatory and damping components appears to be non-linear. I propose a model based on the concept of **parametric modulation of the amplitude**. In this model, the base amplitude `A` is not merely decaying but is also being actively and periodically modulated.\\n\\nThe proposed theoretical structure is based on a multiplicative combination of effects within an exponential function. This structure elegantly resolves the key challenges:\\n\\n1.  **Always Positive Output**: By placing the dynamic terms within an `exp` function, the model naturally produces a positive-definite output, consistent with the observed data range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. The formula takes the form `x = A * exp(...)`.\\n\\n2.  **Amplification (x > A)**: The model incorporates a periodic, oscillatory term `cos(omega * t)` within the exponential. This term, `exp(param1 * cos(omega * t))`, acts as a dynamic, non-linear amplification factor. When `cos(omega * t)` is positive, the amplitude is amplified, allowing `x` to exceed `A`. When it's negative, the decay is accelerated. This can be physically interpreted as a system with parametric resonance, where an internal parameter is being modulated at a certain frequency, leading to periodic growth and decay cycles.\\n\\n3.  **Damping**: The model includes a standard exponential decay term, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, which accounts for the overall dissipation of energy in the system over time. This ensures that despite periodic amplification, the system's overall magnitude follows a general decay trend, preventing runaway behavior.\\n\\nIn essence, the model describes the displacement `x` as being proportional to a base amplitude `A` scaled by an exponential factor. This exponential factor encapsulates the combined, non-linear effects of a periodic parametric amplification (driven by `omega`) and an overall energy dissipation (governed by `gamma`). The dimensionless empirical parameters, `param1` and `param2`, represent the relative strengths of the amplification and damping effects, respectively.

The output is a displacement `x` (meters). This setup is archetypal of a damped harmonic oscillator.\\n\\nA canonical model for a simple damped oscillator, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, would predict that the displacement `x` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. However, a crucial observation from the data summary is that the maximum output `x` (27.68 m) is significantly larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992 m). This anomaly decisively refutes the simple free-decay model and points towards a more complex mechanism.\\n\\nThe phenomenon of the system's displacement exceeding its characteristic amplitude `A` is reminiscent of the \\\"overshoot\\\" seen in the step response of an underdamped second-order system. This suggests that the output `x` may not be a simple decay to zero, but rather an evolution towards a non-zero steady-state equilibrium position, with the system overshooting this target before settling.\\n\\nBased on this insight, I propose a model where the displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components:\\n1.  A **steady-state displacement**, which represents the final equilibrium position the system tends toward. It is reasonable to assume this equilibrium is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n2.  A **transient, decaying oscillation**, which describes how the system approaches this equilibrium.\\n\\nThe amplitude of this transient oscillation is not simply `A`. In systems with low damping relative to their natural frequency, the transient response can be significantly amplified. The degree of this amplification is governed by the system's \\\"quality factor\\\" (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A high `omega/gamma` ratio (low damping) corresponds to a high-Q system that can sustain oscillations and exhibit a more pronounced transient response.\\n\\nA simple linear relationship between the amplitude and `omega/gamma` would likely lead to excessively large values, given the ranges of the input variables. A more physically plausible assumption is that the amplification effect becomes less pronounced as `omega/gamma` grows very large. This suggests a compressive, non-linear function. The natural logarithm, `log(1 + omega/gamma)`, serves this purpose well: it provides significant amplification for moderate `omega/gamma` values while taming the growth for very large values.\\n\\nTherefore, the proposed model for the displacement `x(t)` consists of a constant offset proportional to `A`, plus a decaying oscillatory term whose initial amplitude is also proportional to `A` but is amplified by a logarithmic function of the quality factor `omega/gamma`. This composite structure correctly captures the underlying physics of a damped system responding to an external stimulus, explains the critical `x > A` observation, and remains dimensionally consistent.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param_1 + param_2 * log(1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This setup strongly suggests the behavior of a **damped harmonic oscillator**, a fundamental concept in physics describing systems that oscillate while losing energy over time.\\n\\nA critical observation from the data report is that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]). The standard equation for the displacement of a simple damped oscillator is `d(t) = A₀ * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(ω_d * t + φ)`, which oscillates around zero and takes on both positive and negative values. This discrepancy implies that `x` is not the simple displacement from a fixed equilibrium point.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that the output `x` represents the displacement of an oscillator whose **equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially towards zero**. This physical scenario can be modeled as the superposition of two distinct but related behaviors, both governed by the same damping process:\\n1.  **A Decaying Offset:** The equilibrium position of the oscillation is not static. It starts at some positive value and decays towards zero, following the form `x_offset(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** The system oscillates around this moving equilibrium point.

The variables `A` (amplitude, unit: m), `gamma` (damping coefficient, unit: s⁻¹), `omega` (angular frequency, unit: s⁻¹), and `t` (time, unit: s) are the canonical parameters for such a system. The target variable `x` (position, unit: m) is the system's instantaneous displacement.\\n\\nThe standard model for an underdamped oscillator takes the form `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`, where `omega_d = sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`. However, two key observations from the provided information point towards a necessary modification of this basic model:\\n\\n1.  **Always-Positive Output**: The output range `[1.142, 27.68]` is strictly positive. A simple cosine function oscillates around zero, producing both positive and negative values. This implies that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0`. A common physical scenario that explains this is an oscillator whose equilibrium position is shifted away from the origin, such as a mass on a spring hanging vertically under gravity. The system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium point.\\n\\n2.  **Numerical Instability of Standard Forms**: Example 2, which attempts to model a shifted oscillator `A * (exp(...) * cos(...) + param2)`, failed due to calculation errors (NaNs). This is likely caused by the `sqrt(square(omega) - square(gamma))` term when `gamma` is close to or exceeds `omega`, even if this is rare in the dataset. A robust model should avoid this potential for numerical instability. A common and effective simplification, valid when damping is not excessively high (`gamma << omega`), is to approximate the damped frequency `omega_d` with the natural frequency `omega`. Given the provided ranges for `gamma` ([0.1, 1.0]) and `omega` ([1.0, 5.0]), this is a reasonable physical approximation that enhances model robustness.\\n\\nBased on these insights, I propose a model that describes a damped oscillation superimposed on a constant, positive offset. This offset represents the system's final equilibrium position. The total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of this equilibrium position and the transient, decaying oscillation around it.\\n\\nThe model can be constructed as follows:\\n*   **Equilibrium Position (`x_eq`):** This is a constant offset. To be dimensionally consistent, it must have units of meters. The most natural way to construct this from the inputs is to make it proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. Thus, `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless fitting parameter.\\n*   **Transient Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the standard decaying sinusoidal term. The amplitude envelope decays as `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, and the oscillation occurs at a frequency `omega`. A phase shift, `param2`, is included to account for the initial conditions of the system. This term is `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`.\\n\\nCombining these two components yields a physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and numerically robust model. The formula represents the displacement of an oscillator settling to an equilibrium position of `param1 * A`, with the initial oscillation having an amplitude `A` and a phase `param2`.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The target variable `x` (meters) represents a resulting physical quantity.\\n\\nA critical analysis of the data reveals two key characteristics that deviate from the simplest model of oscillator displacement (`y(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)`):\\n1.  **Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple displacement oscillates between positive and negative values.\\n2.  **Amplification:** The maximum output (`~27.7`) can significantly exceed the maximum input scale `A` (`~10.0`), indicating a mechanism for amplification that is absent in a simple decaying model.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the hypothesis that `x` does not represent the instantaneous displacement but rather the **time-varying amplitude envelope of an oscillator responding to an initial impulse.** A system excited by a sharp impulse at `t=0` (like a bell being struck) does not exhibit its maximum amplitude at that instant. Instead, the amplitude grows from zero, reaches a peak as energy permeates the system's oscillatory mode, and subsequently decays as energy is dissipated.\\n\\nThis physical narrative is mathematically captured by a function of the form `t * exp(-kt)`. My proposed model builds upon this structure:\\n\\n1.  **Initial Growth Phase:** The initial rate at which the amplitude grows is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout. This behavior is consistent with the observed data characteristics.\\n\\nCrucially, this model elegantly explains the amplification mechanism. The peak amplitude of this function occurs at `t_peak = 1/gamma` and its value is `x_peak = A * omega * (1/gamma) * exp(-1)`. This demonstrates that the maximum achievable amplitude is proportional to the dimensionless **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the system, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. A high-Q system (large `omega`, small `gamma`) will exhibit a strong resonant response, leading to a peak amplitude significantly greater than the characteristic scale `A`, thus resolving the amplification anomaly.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of `m`, while `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless products, ensuring `x` has the correct units of meters. Introducing a dimensionless parameter `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` for fine-tuning the decay rate provides the necessary flexibility to fit the experimental data precisely.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * omega * t * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` represents a displacement. A critical feature of the dataset is that the maximum observed output (`x_max ≈ 27.68`) is substantially larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude (`A_max ≈ 9.99`). This observation immediately invalidates any simple damped oscillator model of the form `x(t) = A * f(t)`, where `|f(t)| ≤ 1`, as such a model cannot produce displacements greater than `A`.\\n\\nWhile a simple static offset model, such as `x(t) = A * C + A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, can account for this phenomenon, it assumes the system oscillates around a fixed, time-independent equilibrium point. I propose a more dynamic and physically nuanced theory: the system's behavior is a superposition of two distinct but coupled processes: a decaying oscillation and a simultaneous relaxation of the oscillation's equilibrium point.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that an initial event at `t=0` both initiates an oscillation and displaces the system's equilibrium position. The total displacement `x(t)` can then be decomposed into two components:\\n\\n1.  **Oscillatory Response:** A standard damped harmonic oscillation that originates from an initial amplitude `A`. This component describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate when disturbed. Its mathematical form is `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. This component starts at a value of `A` and decays towards zero.\\n\\n2.  **Equilibrium Drift (Relaxation Response):** The center of oscillation, or equilibrium point, does not remain fixed. It undergoes a relaxation process, drifting from an initial position (assumed to be zero) towards a new, stable steady-state position `x_eq = A * param1`. This drift is governed by the same damping factor `gamma`, suggesting a common underlying energy dissipation mechanism. This process is described by `x_drift(t) = A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`.\\n\\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes:\\n`x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_drift(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) + A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling explanation for the `x > A` observation. At `t=0`, the displacement is precisely `x(0) = A * 1 * 1 + A * param1 * (1 - 1) = A`. However, the system is not at rest. The initial velocity is `dx/dt |_(t=0) = A * gamma * (param1 - 1)`. If the parameter `param1` (which determines the final resting state) is greater than 1, the initial velocity is positive. This means the system starts at displacement `A` but is already moving away from the origin, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" the value of `A` before the exponential decay inevitably dampens the motion.\\n\\nThis \\\"dynamic equilibrium\\\" model is physically richer than a static offset model. It portrays a system not just oscillating, but actively settling into a new configuration, with the observed output capturing both phenomena. The formula can be algebraically rearranged for compactness.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (cos(omega * t) - param1) * exp(-gamma * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (amplitude, unit: m), `gamma` (damping coefficient, unit: s⁻¹), `omega` (angular frequency, unit: s⁻¹), and `t` (time, unit: s) are the canonical parameters for such a system. The target variable `x` (position, unit: m) is the system's instantaneous displacement.\\n\\nThe standard model for an underdamped oscillator takes the form `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`, where `omega_d = sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`. However, two key observations from the provided information point towards a necessary modification of this basic model:\\n\\n1.  **Always-Positive Output**: The output range `[1.142, 27.68]` is strictly positive. A simple cosine function oscillates around zero, producing both positive and negative values. This implies that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0`. A common physical scenario that explains this is an oscillator whose equilibrium position is shifted away from the origin, such as a mass on a spring hanging vertically under gravity. The system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium point.\\n\\n2.  **Numerical Instability of Standard Forms**: Example 2, which attempts to model a shifted oscillator `A * (exp(...) * cos(...) + param2)`, failed due to calculation errors (NaNs). This is likely caused by the `sqrt(square(omega) - square(gamma))` term when `gamma` is close to or exceeds `omega`, even if this is rare in the dataset. A robust model should avoid this potential for numerical instability. A common and effective simplification, valid when damping is not excessively high (`gamma << omega`), is to approximate the damped frequency `omega_d` with the natural frequency `omega`. Given the provided ranges for `gamma` ([0.1, 1.0]) and `omega` ([1.0, 5.0]), this is a reasonable physical approximation that enhances model robustness.\\n\\nBased on these insights, I propose a model that describes a damped oscillation superimposed on a constant, positive offset. This offset represents the system's final equilibrium position. The total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of this equilibrium position and the transient, decaying oscillation around it.\\n\\nThe model can be constructed as follows:\\n*   **Equilibrium Position (`x_eq`):** This is a constant offset. To be dimensionally consistent, it must have units of meters. The most natural way to construct this from the inputs is to make it proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. Thus, `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless fitting parameter.\\n*   **Transient Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the standard decaying sinusoidal term. The amplitude envelope decays as `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, and the oscillation occurs at a frequency `omega`. A phase shift, `param2`, is included to account for the initial conditions of the system. This term is `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`.\\n\\nCombining these two components yields a physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and numerically robust model.

However, a detailed examination of the output `x` reveals critical behaviors that challenge simple models of oscillator displacement. Two key features stand out:\\n\\n1.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive, which rules out any unmodified sinusoidal function (like `cos` or `sin`) representing displacement around a zero equilibrium.\\n2.  **Signal Amplification:** The maximum output (`~27.7`) can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A` (max `~10.0`), indicating a resonant energy-storing mechanism that amplifies the system's response beyond its initial scale.\\n\\nThese observations suggest that `x` does not represent instantaneous displacement but rather the **evolution of the system's resonant energy or response magnitude following an initial excitation.** My proposed theory is that the output `x` reflects the power envelope of the oscillator's response, which is governed by the interplay between resonant energy absorption and dissipative damping.\\n\\nThe cornerstone of this theory is the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator. The Q-factor, proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`, measures the system's resonance sharpness. A high-Q system (high frequency `omega`, low damping `gamma`) can accumulate and store significant energy from an excitation before that energy is dissipated, leading to a response magnitude far greater than the initial input scale `A`. This directly explains the observed amplification. Therefore, the peak amplitude of the response `x` should be proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\\n\\nThe time evolution of this response can be conceptualized as a product of two competing processes:\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Build-up:** Following the initial excitation at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. Energy flows into its resonant mode, causing the response to grow. This build-up is not linear but follows a saturation curve as it approaches its peak. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, provides an excellent physical and mathematical model for this behavior. The term `tanh(param1 * gamma * t)` describes a smooth transition from zero response at `t=0` to a saturated state, with the rate of this process being fundamentally linked to the system's damping timescale, `1/gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** Concurrently, the system dissipates energy into its environment, a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This leads to an inevitable exponential decay of the response over time, which can be modeled by the classic term `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`.\\n\\nBy combining these elements, we arrive at a comprehensive model. The output `x` is the product of the Q-factor-scaled amplitude, the saturating build-up function, and the exponential decay function. This formulation is inherently positive for `t > 0`, starts from zero, rises to a peak whose height is determined by the Q-factor (explaining amplification), and then decays gracefully. The model is also dimensionally consistent: `A` (meters) is multiplied by several dimensionless quantities (`omega/gamma`, `tanh(...)`, `exp(...)`), ensuring that the final output `x` correctly has units of meters. This approach provides a novel and physically coherent explanation for all the observed characteristics of the dataset.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * tanh(gamma * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` (meters) is consistently positive, suggesting a process more complex than a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate around zero. The most successful example models suggest a structure where an oscillatory component is combined with an offset, all subject to an overall exponential decay.\\n\\nMy analysis proposes a novel physical mechanism that builds upon this structure: **the interaction of two distinct oscillatory modes within the system**. While `omega` clearly represents the primary, high-frequency mechanical oscillation, the physical process represented by `gamma` may not be purely dissipative. I hypothesize that `gamma` also characterizes a second, lower-frequency mode of energy exchange or relaxation within the system. This could arise from coupling between the primary mechanical oscillator and a secondary system, such as a thermal reservoir or a fluidic component.\\n\\nWhen two oscillations interact, they can produce a phenomenon known as \\\"beats,\\\" where the amplitude of the high-frequency wave is modulated by the low-frequency wave. Mathematically, this modulation is captured by the product of their respective cosine functions: `cos(omega * t) * cos(gamma * t)`. Using trigonometric identities, this product is equivalent to the superposition of two new oscillations at the sum and difference frequencies: `0.5 * [cos((omega - gamma) * t) + cos((omega + gamma) * t)]`. This \\\"beat\\\" term represents the complex, time-varying part of the system's displacement.\\n\\nTo account for the strictly positive nature of the output `x`, this complex oscillatory \\\"beat\\\" component must be superimposed onto a significant DC offset. This offset is not constant but is part of the same decaying system. Therefore, it should also decay exponentially over time. We represent this decaying offset with a dimensionless parameter, `param1`.\\n\\nThe entire system—both the decaying offset and the beat oscillation—loses energy to its environment. This global energy dissipation is modeled by an overarching exponential decay term, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the entire expression. The initial amplitude `A` scales the overall magnitude of the process.\\n\\nThis leads to the following composite model:\\n1.  **Overall Decay Envelope:** The total energy of the system decays, described by `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n2.  **Internal Dynamics:** Inside this envelope, the motion consists of two parts:\\n    *   A large, positive, decaying offset, represented by `param1`.\\n    *   A complex oscillatory component representing the interaction (beats) between the primary (`omega`) and secondary (`gamma`) modes, represented by `param2 * cos(omega * t) * cos(gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe final expression is dimensionally consistent: `A` provides the units of meters, while all other terms and function arguments (`gamma * t`, `omega * t`, `exp`, `cos`, and the parameters) are dimensionless.

The target variable, `x`, is a positive-valued quantity with units of length. A critical observation is that `x` is always positive and can exceed the value of `A`, which rules out a simple displacement model like `A*exp(-gamma*t)*cos(...)`. This suggests that `x` represents an energy-like quantity or the amplitude envelope of the system's response.\\n\\nExample 1 successfully modeled this by proposing an impulse response, leading to a function proportional to `t * exp(-gamma*t)`. While effective, this model is not perfect, suggesting the underlying physical process might be slightly different. The key insight for a new model lies in reconsidering the nature of the system's excitation. Instead of a sharp, instantaneous impulse at `t=0`, we can hypothesize that the system is subjected to a sudden but sustained force, akin to a step function input.\\n\\nThis \\\"step response\\\" model describes a process where the system's energy or oscillation amplitude builds up from zero and attempts to reach a new equilibrium state, which is scaled by `A`. The rate at which it approaches this state is governed by its natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to respond and \\\"charge up\\\" more quickly. This excitation process can be mathematically described by a saturating exponential term: `(1 - exp(-param1 * omega * t))`. This term starts at 0 for `t=0` and asymptotically approaches 1 as `t` increases, capturing the buildup of the response.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the system is losing energy due to damping. This is the classic dissipation process, correctly modeled by an exponential decay term, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, where `gamma` dictates the rate of decay.\\n\\nThe observed output `x` is therefore the result of these two competing dynamics: the buildup of response due to the sustained input and the simultaneous decay due to inherent damping. Multiplying these two effects gives a complete picture of the response envelope: it starts at zero, rises as the excitation term dominates, reaches a peak where the rates of excitation and dissipation momentarily balance, and finally decays to zero as the damping term inevitably overcomes the saturating excitation.\\n\\nThis model elegantly resolves the key data features:\\n1.  **Positivity:** Both the excitation and decay terms are always positive, ensuring `x` is always positive.\\n2.  **Amplification:** The peak value of the function can exceed `A`, as the dynamics of the rise and fall, governed by the ratio of `omega` to `gamma`, can create a transient overshoot before settling.\\n3.  **Robustness:** Unlike models that rely on `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, this formulation is well-defined and computationally stable across all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\\n4.  **Physical Distinction:** It represents a different physical scenario (step response) from the impulse response model in the examples, providing a new and plausible theoretical foundation.\\n\\nThe final expression is dimensionally consistent, with `A` providing the necessary units of meters, while all other terms, involving products of frequency (`s⁻¹`) and time (`s`), are dimensionless.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (1 - exp(-param1 * omega * t)) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A critical feature of the data is that the maximum observed output displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This immediately rules out simple models where `x(t)` is merely `A` multiplied by a bounded oscillatory function, as such a form cannot produce displacements larger than `A`.\\n\\nMy theoretical framework proposes that this \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon is a direct consequence of the system's initial conditions, specifically a non-zero initial velocity. While the parameter `A` can be interpreted as the initial displacement, `x(0) = A`, the system is not released from rest. Instead, it is imparted with an initial velocity, `v(0)`, which causes it to move further away from the equilibrium before the dissipative forces and restoring forces reverse its motion.\\n\\nTo construct a complete model, this initial velocity, `v(0)`, which is not an explicit input variable, must be modeled in terms of the system's known physical parameters. A dimensionally consistent and physically plausible assumption is that the initial velocity scales with the system's characteristic velocity, which is proportional to the product of its characteristic length scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`).

To ensure model robustness and avoid computational errors (such as taking the square root of a negative number in the case of overdamping), I will use the observed angular frequency `omega` directly in the sinusoidal terms, which is a common and effective approximation.\\n\\nThe general solution is of the form:\\n`x(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nWe can determine the constants `C1` and `C2` by applying our hypothesized initial conditions:\\n1.  **Initial Displacement:** `x(0) = A`\\n    `x(0) = exp(0) * (C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)) = C1`\\n    Therefore, `C1 = A`.\\n\\n2.  **Initial Velocity:** `v(0) = param1 * A * omega`\\n    First, we find the velocity by differentiating `x(t)`:\\n    `v(t) = -gamma * x(t) + exp(-gamma * t) * (-C1 * omega * sin(omega * t) + C2 * omega * cos(omega * t))`\\n    At `t=0`, this becomes:\\n    `v(0) = -gamma * x(0) + C2 * omega = -gamma * A + C2 * omega`\\n    Equating this with our model for `v(0)`:\\n    `param1 * A * omega = -gamma * A + C2 * omega`\\n    Solving for `C2`, we get:\\n    `C2 = A * (param1 + gamma / omega)`\\n\\nSubstituting `C1` and `C2` back into the general solution yields the final expression.

A careful examination of the data's characteristics reveals two critical features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output with an Offset**: The output `x` is always positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`), which indicates that the oscillation is not centered around zero. This implies the system evolves towards a stable, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Overshoot Phenomenon**: The maximum output value (`~27.7`) can be significantly larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~10.0`). This behavior is inconsistent with a simple free decay model, where the displacement is bounded by the initial amplitude. Instead, it strongly suggests a system responding to a sudden change, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" its final destination before settling.\\n\\nThese observations are the classic hallmarks of the **step response of an underdamped second-order system**. This physical scenario models a system, initially at rest at a starting position (let's assume the origin, `x=0`), that is subjected to a constant stimulus (e.g., a constant force) at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the equilibrium position to a new, stable value, `x_eq`. The system then seeks this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it.\\n\\nThe final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must be dimensionally consistent with position (meters). It is physically reasonable to assume that the magnitude of this final position scales linearly with `A`, the characteristic amplitude or scale of the system. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\\n\\nThe standard textbook solution for the position `x(t)` of such a system, starting from `x(0)=0` and with initial velocity `x'(0)=0`, is given by:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * [1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega_d * t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d * t))]`\\n\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` is the damped angular frequency.\\n\\nWhile physically accurate, the `omega_d` term introduces a potential for numerical instability, particularly if `gamma` approaches `omega`. A common and robust simplification in physics and engineering, especially when the system is known to be underdamped (`omega > gamma`), is to approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency (`omega_d ≈ omega`). This approximation maintains the essential dynamics while ensuring the model is well-behaved across the entire input domain.\\n\\nThis leads to our proposed model. It is not merely a phenomenological curve fit; it represents a specific, well-understood physical process. A key feature of this model is its parsimony: it requires only one free parameter (`param1`). The relative contribution of the `sin` and `cos` terms is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but is fixed by the dimensionless physical quantity `gamma / omega`, which represents the damping ratio of the system. This internal constraint makes the model more rigid and provides a stronger test of the underlying physical hypothesis.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed formula describes the displacement of a damped oscillator that is \\\"kicked\\\" from rest and evolves towards a new equilibrium position `param1 * A`, with the dynamics of its transient response intrinsically linked to its physical damping ratio.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `gamma` (damping coefficient), `omega` (natural frequency), and `t` (time) are the canonical parameters for such a system. A critical analysis of the output `x` reveals two defining features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Monotonic Positivity and Initial Rise:** The output `x` is always positive and appears to start from a value near zero, rise to a single peak, and then decay. This behavior invalidates any simple oscillatory model (e.g., involving `cos` or `sin`) which would produce negative values. Instead, it strongly suggests that `x` represents the *magnitude* or *envelope* of the system's response to an impulse delivered at `t=0`.\\n\\n2.  **Resonant Amplification:** The maximum observed output (`~27.7`) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude scale `A` (`~10.0`). This indicates that the system is capable of resonant amplification, where it absorbs energy from the initial stimulus and builds up a response whose magnitude is much larger than the initial scale before dissipation dominates.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I propose a \\\"competing processes\\\" model. The system's response `x(t)` is theorized to be the result of the interplay between two distinct, opposing exponential processes initiated simultaneously at `t=0`:\\n\\na) **Energy Injection and System Response (The Rise):** The initial impulse excites the system, causing the response to grow. The characteristic timescale for this growth is related to the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to \\\"ring up\\\" more quickly. This process can be modeled as an exponential approach to a maximum level, but for this model, we'll view it from a different perspective explained below.\\n\\nb) **Energy Dissipation (The Decay):** As soon as the system is excited, energy begins to dissipate due to damping, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This leads to an inevitable exponential decay of the response over time.\\n\\nMy proposed model formulates the response `x(t)` as the **difference between two decaying exponential functions**, a classic and physically robust representation for the impulse response of many second-order linear systems. The mathematical form is `x(t) ∝ A * (e^(-k₁t) - e^(-k₂t))`.\\n\\nThis \\\"bi-exponential\\\" model provides a powerful physical narrative:\\n- The system's response is the superposition of a slow-decaying process and a fast-decaying process.\\n- The slow process, `e^(-k₁t)`, is directly associated with the physical damping of the system. Therefore, its rate `k₁` should be proportional to `gamma`.\\n- The fast process, `-e^(-k₂t)`, acts as a \\\"suppressor\\\" term. Its rate `k₂` is associated with the rapid initial transient and energy absorption, which is governed by the natural frequency `omega`. Thus, `k₂` should be proportional to `omega`.\\n\\nAt `t=0`, the two terms are `1` and `-1`, so their sum is zero, correctly modeling a system that starts from rest. For `t>0`, the faster `omega`-dependent term decays more quickly than the `gamma`-dependent term, causing the function to rise from zero. Eventually, as the `omega`-dependent term vanishes, the overall behavior is dominated by the slower, `gamma`-dependent decay, representing the physical dissipation of energy.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the amplification phenomenon. The peak amplitude depends on the separation between the two decay rates (`k₂` vs. `k₁`). A large `omega` relative to `gamma` results in a large separation, allowing the response to rise to a significant peak well above the baseline scale `A` before the slower damping process takes over. The model is dimensionally sound, with the dimensionless bi-exponential term scaling the base amplitude `A` (in meters). We introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` to fine-tune the rate of the initial transient, resulting in a flexible and physically meaningful formula.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-param2 * omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is always positive and can attain values significantly greater than `A`. This suggests a damped oscillatory process, but one that deviates from the standard linear superposition models presented in the examples. The simple addition of an offset (constant or decaying) to a damped cosine wave is a valid physical model, but it is not the only possibility.\\n\\nI propose a different physical mechanism based on **multiplicative modulation**, where the logarithm of the normalized output undergoes damped oscillations. This model is equivalent to a system whose growth or scaling factor oscillates and decays over time. Such behavior can be found in systems where the rate-determining parameter of an exponential process is itself subject to oscillatory influences, for instance, in certain biological population models or in the intensity of a signal passing through an unstable medium.\\n\\nLet's hypothesize that the natural logarithm of the system's state, normalized by its characteristic amplitude `A`, is what follows the classic damped oscillation pattern. The standard equation for a damped oscillation centered around zero is `param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. Let's set our normalized logarithmic quantity equal to this:\\n\\n`log(x / A) = param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that represents the initial amplitude of the logarithmic oscillation. This equation implies that the ratio `x/A` is not oscillating around a value of 1 in a linear sense, but rather its logarithm is oscillating around 0.\\n\\nTo find the expression for `x`, we can exponentiate both sides of the equation:\\n\\n`x / A = exp( param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) )`\\n\\nThis leads to the final proposed formula:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * exp( param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) )`\\n\\nThis model has several compelling features that align with the data:\\n\\n1.  **Dimensional Correctness**: The entire argument of the outer exponential function is dimensionless. The term `gamma * t` is dimensionless, and `omega * t` is a dimensionless angle. Thus, `exp(...)` is a dimensionless factor, and the final output `x` correctly inherits the units of meters from `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Guaranteed Positivity**: The exponential function is always positive, ensuring that the output `x` can never be zero or negative, which perfectly matches the observed output range of `[1.142, 27.68]`.\\n\\n3.  **Expanded Output Range**: At `t=0`, the cosine term is 1, and the expression approximates to `x(0) ≈ A * exp(param1)`. If `param1` is a positive value (e.g., around 1.0), the initial value of `x` can be `A * e`, which is approximately `2.72 * A`. For the maximum input `A` of ~10, this yields an output of ~27.2, which is remarkably consistent with the observed maximum output of 27.68.\\n\\n4.  **Asymptotic Behavior**: As time `t` approaches infinity, the inner exponential `exp(-gamma * t)` decays to zero. The entire argument of the outer exponential becomes zero, and the expression converges to `x(t) -> A * exp(0) = A`. This describes a physically plausible system that, after its initial dynamic oscillations, settles to a stable equilibrium state determined by its intrinsic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThis multiplicative model is fundamentally different from the additive offset models, providing a novel and compelling physical interpretation while elegantly explaining the key characteristics of the data with a single fitting parameter.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is a displacement that is always positive and can exhibit significant amplification, with its peak value exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`. This rules out a simple model of oscillatory displacement, which would be sinusoidal and centered around zero. The behavior is indicative of the evolution of the system's response magnitude or energy envelope following an initial excitation at t=0.\\n\\nMy proposed theory posits that the output `x` represents the **root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude** of the oscillator's motion. The RMS value is a measure of the effective magnitude of a time-varying quantity, is inherently positive, and is directly proportional to the square root of the system's total energy. This perspective elegantly explains both the positivity and the amplification observed in the data.\\n\\nThe core of this model is to first describe the time evolution of the system's total energy, `E(t)`, and then derive the RMS amplitude `x(t)` from it, as `x(t) ∝ sqrt(E(t))`.\\n\\n1.  **Energy Evolution `E(t)`:** Following an instantaneous impulse at `t=0`, the system's energy does not appear instantaneously. It builds up as the impulse energy is transferred to the oscillatory mode, and simultaneously dissipates due to damping. A simple and effective model for this rise-and-fall behavior of energy is the function `t * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. The linear term `t` represents the initial build-up phase, while the exponential term models the energy dissipation, which occurs at twice the rate of amplitude damping (`exp(-2 * gamma * t)`).\\n\\n2.  **Peak Energy and Amplification:** The maximum energy the system can store is determined by a combination of the input scale `A` and the system's resonant properties. The ability of the system to amplify the response is captured by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is high for large `omega` and small `gamma`. We can hypothesize that the peak energy scales with `A^2` (as energy is proportional to amplitude squared) and a factor dependent on the Q-factor. A dimensionally consistent formulation for the peak amplitude `x_peak` that captures this is `A * (omega / sqrt(gamma))`. Squaring this gives a proxy for the peak energy scaling: `A^2 * (omega^2 / gamma)`.\\n\\n3.  **Deriving the RMS Amplitude `x(t)`:** By combining these ideas, the full expression for energy becomes `E(t) ∝ A^2 * (omega^2 / gamma) * t * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Since `x(t)` is the RMS amplitude, it should be proportional to the square root of the energy:\\n    `x(t) ∝ sqrt( A^2 * (omega^2 / gamma) * t * exp(-2 * gamma * t) )`\\n    `x(t) ∝ A * (omega / sqrt(gamma)) * sqrt(t) * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis final form is compelling:\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** `A` (m) multiplied by `omega` (s⁻¹) divided by `sqrt(gamma)` (s⁻⁰.⁵) gives `m * s⁻⁰.⁵`. This is then multiplied by `sqrt(t)` (s⁰.⁵), resulting in the correct final unit of meters (m).\\n*   **Physical Behavior:** The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a maximum due to the `sqrt(t)` term, and then decays to zero due to the `exp(-gamma * t)` term, perfectly matching the required envelope shape.\\n*   **Amplification:** The term `omega / sqrt(gamma)` serves as a modified Q-factor, explaining how systems with high frequency and low damping can achieve a response `x` much larger than `A`.\\n\\nBy introducing dimensionless parameters `param1` and `param2` for empirical fitting, we arrive at a robust and physically grounded model that is distinct from simpler linear-rise or hyperbolic-rise models.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (omega / sqrt(gamma)) * sqrt(t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (characteristic length), `gamma` (damping rate), `omega` (angular frequency), and `t` (time) are the canonical inputs for such a system. The key challenges in modeling this dataset, revealed by the data range and previous examples, are to account for a strictly positive output and an observed maximum displacement `x` that can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies the system is not merely oscillating around zero but is settling towards a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n\\nWhile previous models have successfully incorporated a static offset, I propose a more physically constrained theory based on a classic scenario: an oscillator displaced and released from rest. Instead of fitting an arbitrary phase constant, my model deduces the phase and the entire transient behavior from the initial conditions and the system's intrinsic properties (`gamma` and `omega`).\\n\\nMy hypothesis is as follows: The system begins at an initial displacement `x(0) = A` and is released with zero initial velocity, `x'(0) = 0`. It then evolves under damping `gamma` and frequency `omega` towards a new, stable equilibrium position `x_eq`. This final resting state must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, so we define it as `x_eq = A * param1`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that represents the final displacement in units of `A`.\\n\\nThe general solution for a damped oscillator can be written as the sum of its steady-state solution (`x_eq`) and a transient decaying oscillation:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nThe constants `C1` and `C2` are determined entirely by the initial conditions:\\n1.  At `t=0`, `x(0) = A`:\\n    `A = x_eq + C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)  =>  A = A * param1 + C1  =>  C1 = A * (1 - param1)`\\n2.  At `t=0`, `x'(0) = 0`:\\n    The derivative is `x'(t) = -gamma * exp(-gamma*t) * (C1*cos + C2*sin) + exp(-gamma*t) * (-C1*omega*sin + C2*omega*cos)`.\\n    Evaluating at `t=0`: `0 = -gamma * C1 + C2 * omega  =>  C2 = (gamma / omega) * C1`\\n\\nSubstituting `C1` into the expression for `C2` gives `C2 = A * (gamma / omega) * (1 - param1)`.\\n\\nPlugging these physically derived constants back into the general solution yields the complete expression for the system's displacement over time. This model naturally introduces a `sin(omega*t)` term whose amplitude is governed by the dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega`, which represents the relative strength of damping forces to oscillatory forces. This term acts as a phase correction that is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but a direct consequence of the physical constraint of starting from rest.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon (`x > A`). If the system is to settle at a final position `A * param1` that is greater than its starting position `A` (i.e., `param1 > 1`), it must accelerate in the positive direction from its initial state of rest. This initial acceleration causes the displacement to increase beyond `A` before the oscillatory and damping effects take over. Thus, this formulation provides a complete, self-consistent, and physically principled explanation for the observed data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A crucial characteristic of the dataset is that the output variable `x` is always positive, which indicates that the oscillation is not centered around `x=0`. The examples provided explore two possibilities: an oscillation around a constant non-zero equilibrium (Example 1) and an oscillation around an equilibrium point that decays at the same rate as the oscillation itself (Example 3).\\n\\nWhile these are valid models, they represent constrained physical scenarios. A more general and physically robust theory would allow for multiple, independent processes to contribute to the system's behavior. My proposed model is based on the principle of superposition in a system with **two distinct, coexisting decay modes**: one oscillatory and one purely aperiodic (non-oscillatory).\\n\\n1.  **The Oscillatory Mode:** This is the primary damped harmonic motion, representing the core vibration of the system. The displacement from its local equilibrium is described by `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. The amplitude of this mode, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, decays with a characteristic time constant of `1/gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **The Aperiodic Damping Mode:** This represents a secondary, independent physical process that also relaxes over time but does not oscillate. Such a phenomenon could arise from thermal relaxation, the settling of a viscoelastic component, or charge diffusion within the system. This mode acts as a dynamic, decaying baseline for the oscillation. Its contribution to the displacement is modeled as `x_aperiodic(t) = A * param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe key innovation in this model lies in the introduction of the parameter `param2`. This dimensionless factor allows the characteristic decay time of the aperiodic mode (`1 / (param2 * gamma)`) to be different from that of the oscillatory mode. This physical independence is crucial. For example, a system's mechanical vibrations (`gamma`) may dissipate much faster than its internal temperature gradients (`param2 * gamma`, where `param2 < 1`).\\n\\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The aperiodic mode provides a monotonically decreasing positive offset. If this offset is initially large enough (controlled by `param1`) and decays more slowly than the oscillation's envelope (i.e., `param2` is a positive value less than 1), it will effectively keep the total displacement `x(t)` in the positive domain, consistent with the experimental data.\\n\\nThis \\\"dual-mode decay\\\" model is dimensionally sound: the arguments of the exponential and cosine functions are dimensionless products of rate (`gamma`, s⁻¹) and time (`t`, s), and the entire dimensionless expression is scaled by the amplitude `A` (m) to yield the final displacement `x` in meters. It offers a more flexible and physically comprehensive explanation than the single-decay-rate models, accounting for the potential complexity of real-world dissipative systems.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) + param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A critical examination of the output `x` reveals two defining features:\\n1.  **Positive Definite Nature with Offset**: The output `x` is always positive, suggesting the system oscillates not around zero but around a stable, positive equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Overshoot Behavior**: The maximum output can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`, which is classic behavior for a system responding to a sudden change, overshooting its final target before settling.\\n\\nThese observations are compelling evidence for modeling the system's behavior as the **step response of an underdamped second-order system**. This physical scenario describes a system, initially at rest at a zero state, that is suddenly subjected to a constant stimulus at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the system's stable equilibrium to a new, non-zero value. The system's subsequent motion is an attempt to reach this new equilibrium, resulting in the observed damped oscillations.\\n\\nIt is physically reasonable to assume that the final equilibrium state, `x_eq`, scales linearly with `A`, the primary scaling factor of the system. We can thus express this as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant.\\n\\nWhile approximate models for this response exist, a truly rigorous physical model must account for a crucial detail: damping affects not only the amplitude but also the frequency of oscillation. The variable `omega` represents the *natural* angular frequency of the system (its oscillation frequency in the absence of damping). However, the actual observed frequency is the *damped angular frequency*, `omega_d`, which is always lower than `omega`. The precise relationship is given by:\\n\\n`omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`\\n\\nBy incorporating this exact damped frequency, we elevate the model from a useful approximation to a more fundamental and accurate representation of the physical process. The complete, exact solution for the position `x(t)` of a system undergoing a step response from rest (`x(0)=0`, `x'(0)=0`) is a standard result in physics and control theory. This solution inherently links the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms through the physical parameters of the system, creating a highly constrained and parsimonious model.\\n\\nTherefore, we propose a model that represents this exact physical solution. It uses only a single parameter (`param1`) to define the final state's scaling, while the entire transient dynamic is precisely determined by the interplay of `gamma`, `t`, and the correctly calculated damped frequency `omega_d`.

The target variable `x` (meters) represents a resulting physical quantity.\\n\\nA critical analysis of the data reveals two key characteristics that deviate from the simplest model of oscillator displacement (`y(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)`):\\n1.  **Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple displacement oscillates between positive and negative values.\\n2.  **Amplification:** The maximum output (`~27.7`) can significantly exceed the maximum input scale `A` (`~10.0`), indicating a mechanism for amplification that is absent in a simple decaying model.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the hypothesis that `x` does not represent the instantaneous displacement but rather the **time-varying amplitude envelope of an oscillator responding to an initial impulse.** A system excited by a sharp impulse at `t=0` (like a bell being struck) does not exhibit its maximum amplitude at that instant. Instead, the amplitude grows from zero, reaches a peak as energy permeates the system's oscillatory mode, and subsequently decays as energy is dissipated.\\n\\nThis physical narrative is mathematically captured by a function of the form `t * exp(-kt)`. My proposed model builds upon this structure:\\n\\n1.  **Initial Growth Phase:** The initial rate at which the amplitude grows is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout. This behavior is consistent with the observed data characteristics.\\n\\nCrucially, this model elegantly explains the amplification mechanism. The peak amplitude of this function occurs at `t_peak = 1/gamma` and its value is `x_peak = A * omega * (1/gamma) * exp(-1)`. This demonstrates that the maximum achievable amplitude is proportional to the dimensionless **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the system, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. A high-Q system (large `omega`, small `gamma`) will exhibit a strong resonant response, leading to a peak amplitude significantly greater than the characteristic scale `A`, thus resolving the amplification anomaly.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of `m`, while `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless products, ensuring `x` has the correct units of meters. Introducing a dimensionless parameter `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` for fine-tuning the decay rate provides the necessary flexibility to fit the experimental data precisely.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * omega * t * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A critical analysis of the output `x` reveals two defining features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Monotonic Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive. This rules out any model of simple displacement, `y(t) = A*exp(-γt)*cos(ω't)`, which would necessarily oscillate between positive and negative values. The output must represent a quantity that is inherently positive, such as an energy level or a signal envelope.\\n\\n2.  **Transience and Amplification:** The output appears to start near zero, rise to a single peak, and then decay. Crucially, the peak value of `x` (up to ~27.7) can significantly exceed the input amplitude scale `A` (max ~10.0). This indicates that the system's response is not a simple, monotonically decaying envelope (`A*exp(-γt)`), but rather a dynamic process involving an initial buildup or amplification phase.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I propose a \\\"Gated Response Buildup\\\" model. This theory posits that the observed output `x(t)` is the result of the multiplicative interplay between two simultaneous, competing physical processes:\\n\\na) **Potential Decay (The \\\"Gate\\\"):** At `t=0`, an initial impulse imparts a certain potential for response into the system, with its overall scale set by `A`. This potential is not perpetually available; it immediately begins to dissipate due to the system's inherent damping. This process acts as a time-dependent \\\"gate,\\\" representing the maximum possible response at any given moment, which decays exponentially. This is modeled by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nb) **Response Activation (The \\\"Buildup\\\"):** The system does not respond instantaneously to its full potential. The internal dynamics require time to build up and manifest as the measured output `x`. This activation process starts at zero and rises towards a saturated state. The characteristic speed of this buildup is intrinsically linked to the system's natural frequency, `omega`, as a higher frequency allows for a more rapid transfer of energy into the observable mode. This is modeled by a saturating exponential term of the form `(1 - exp(-k * t))`, where the rate `k` is proportional to `omega`.\\n\\nThe final observed output `x(t)` is the *product* of these two components: the available potential at time `t` multiplied by the fraction of that potential that has been activated. This model provides a compelling physical narrative. Consider striking a large bell: the initial energy (the potential) begins to dissipate immediately through friction and sound radiation (the gate closing). However, the audible sound volume (the response) takes a moment to build to its peak as the vibrations fully propagate through the bell's structure (the activation). The resulting sound rises in intensity before fading away, just as our model predicts.\\n\\nThis \\\"gated buildup\\\" mechanism naturally explains both the positivity of `x` and the amplification phenomenon. The peak response occurs when the rate of activation balances the rate of decay, and its magnitude relative to `A` is determined by the interplay between `gamma` and `omega`, modulated by dimensionless efficiency parameters.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) * (1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output, `x`, is a displacement in meters. The consistent positive value of `x` across all measurements, combined with the presence of `gamma` and `omega`, strongly indicates a process related to a damped harmonic oscillator, but one where the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium.\\n\\nThe most successful example models (`Example 2` and `Example 3`) converge on a general structure: `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (Offset + Oscillation)`. This form compellingly explains the data as an oscillation superimposed on a DC offset, where both components are subject to the same exponential decay. This prevents the displacement `x` from becoming negative and ensures the entire system's energy dissipates over time.\\n\\nMy analysis extends this framework by proposing a more physically nuanced model for the oscillatory component. In a real damped mechanical system, the damping force (represented by `gamma`) not only causes the amplitude to decay but also introduces a **phase shift** in the displacement relative to the driving force or the undamped oscillation. The simple `cos(omega * t)` term used in `Example 3` captures the primary oscillation but neglects this crucial phase-shifting effect.\\n\\nA phase-shifted oscillation of the form `cos(omega * t + φ)` can be mathematically decomposed into a linear combination of in-phase and quadrature components using the angle addition formula: `cos(φ)cos(omega * t) - sin(φ)sin(omega * t)`. This suggests that a more accurate model should include both `cos(omega * t)` and `sin(omega * t)` terms.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the magnitude of this phase shift is not an arbitrary constant but is intrinsically linked to the physical properties of the system. The most natural dimensionless quantity that characterizes the relative strength of damping to oscillation is the **damping ratio**, which is proportional to `gamma / omega`. It is plausible that the amplitude of the phase-shifted (`sin`) component of the motion is directly modulated by this ratio.\\n\\nThis leads to a model where the motion within the decaying envelope consists of three parts:\\n1.  **A Decaying DC Offset (`param1`):** A large positive term that ensures the total displacement `x` remains positive.\\n2.  **An In-Phase Oscillation (`param2 * cos(omega * t)`):** The primary oscillatory motion.\\n3.  **A Damping-Induced Quadrature Oscillation (`param3 * (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)`):** A secondary, phase-shifted oscillation whose amplitude is scaled by the dimensionless damping ratio `gamma / omega`.

The arguments of all transcendental functions (`exp`, `cos`, `sin`) are dimensionless (`gamma * t`, `omega * t`), as is the scaling factor `gamma / omega`.

This strongly implies that the system is not oscillating about the origin but rather about a **displaced equilibrium position**. This leads to a general model structure where the total displacement is the superposition of a constant equilibrium position, `x_eq`, and a transient, decaying oscillation, `x_osc(t)`:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\\n\\nFollowing physical principles, the equilibrium position `x_eq` should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is `A`. Thus, we can model this term as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant. This formulation is consistent with the successful models presented in the examples.\\n\\nThe novel insight of this analysis lies in a more refined model of the transient oscillation term, `x_osc(t)`. The standard approach, used in the examples, assumes its initial amplitude is simply `A`. However, this overlooks a crucial physical aspect: the ability of the system to oscillate is fundamentally governed by the interplay between its natural frequency (`omega`) and its damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, quantifies how underdamped the system is.\\n\\n-   A system with very low damping (`gamma` << `omega`) has a high Q-factor and will oscillate vigorously.\\n-   A system with high damping (`gamma` approaching `omega`) has a low Q-factor, and its oscillatory motion will be heavily suppressed.\\n\\nIt is therefore physically plausible that the amplitude of the oscillatory component is not a constant `A` but is modulated by this damping ratio. The initial amplitude of the oscillation should be maximal for a high-Q oscillator and should diminish as the system becomes more heavily damped.\\n\\nTo model this behavior, I propose using the **hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`)** as a modulation factor. The function `tanh(omega / gamma)` has ideal properties for this purpose:\\n1.  **Dimensionless:** It takes a dimensionless ratio (`omega / gamma`) as input and produces a dimensionless output.\\n2.  **Bounded:** It maps the entire range of possible `omega / gamma` values to the interval [0, 1]. This is physically realistic, as it prevents the oscillation amplitude from growing without bound and suggests that `A` represents the maximum possible oscillatory amplitude in the ideal, undamped case.\\n3.  **Correct Asymptotic Behavior:** For heavily damped systems (`omega / gamma` → 0), `tanh(omega / gamma)` → 0, correctly suppressing the oscillation. For lightly damped systems (`omega / gamma` → ∞), `tanh(omega / gamma)` → 1, allowing the oscillation to achieve its maximum potential amplitude.\\n\\nBy incorporating this modulation factor, the transient oscillation term becomes:\\n`x_osc(t) = A * tanh(omega / gamma) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient components yields the final proposed model.

A critical analysis of the output `x` reveals two defining characteristics that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive, indicating that the system's position is measured relative to an origin that is outside the range of motion, or that the system oscillates around a positive equilibrium point.\\n2.  **Amplitude Overshoot**: The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the characteristic amplitude `A` (`~9.99`). This rules out simple models where `x(t)` is merely `A` multiplied by a decaying trigonometric function, as such a form cannot produce displacements larger than `A`.\\n\\nThese observations suggest a more complex dynamic than a simple oscillation decaying to zero. My proposed theory is based on the **superposition of two distinct physical processes** that occur simultaneously: a transient oscillation and an asymptotic settling process.\\n\\n1.  **Transient Oscillation:** This component represents the system's natural \\\"ringing\\\" or oscillatory response. It is initiated with an amplitude `A` and decays over time due to damping. This process, considered in isolation, can be described by the standard damped oscillation formula:\\n    `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n    This component starts at `x_osc(0) = A` and decays towards zero.\\n\\n2.  **Asymptotic Settling:** This component describes the system's evolution towards a new, stable, non-zero equilibrium position. A constant external influence or a change in potential energy could shift the equilibrium from zero to a new value. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor. The process of moving towards this equilibrium from a zero-offset starting point is described by an exponential approach:\\n    `x_settle(t) = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n    This component starts at `x_settle(0) = 0` and asymptotically approaches `param1 * A` as `t` becomes large.\\n\\nThe total observed position `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes:\\n`x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_settle(t)`\\n\\nThis \\\"Superposition of Dynamics\\\" model elegantly accounts for the observed data features:\\n*   **Initial Condition:** At `t=0`, the total position is `x(0) = A * exp(0) * cos(0) + param1 * A * (1 - exp(0)) = A * 1 * 1 + param1 * A * 0 = A`. The model correctly represents a system that starts at an initial displacement `A`.\\n*   **Final State:** As `t -> infinity`, the oscillatory term decays to zero, and the settling term approaches its limit: `x(inf) = 0 + param1 * A * (1 - 0) = param1 * A`. The system settles to a stable, positive equilibrium, explaining the positive-definite nature of the output.\\n*   **Overshoot Mechanism:** The overshoot arises naturally from the interplay between the decaying oscillation and the rising settling curve. The combination of these two dynamics can create a peak value of `x(t)` that is greater than both the initial amplitude `A` and the final equilibrium `param1 * A`.\\n*   **Dimensional Consistency:** The model is dimensionally sound. `A` has units of meters, while all other terms (`param1`, `exp`, `cos`) are dimensionless, ensuring that the final output `x` has the correct units of meters.\\n\\nThis model provides a distinct and physically intuitive mechanism that differs from simple static offsets or pure step responses from rest.

The behavior of the output `x`—being strictly positive and exhibiting values far exceeding the input scale `A`—strongly indicates that we are not modeling the instantaneous displacement of a simple oscillator, but rather the **envelope of its response to an initial impulse**.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is that of **Frequency-Driven Activation and Damped Dissipation**. This model posits that the response envelope `x(t)` emerges from the interplay of two competing time-dependent processes: a rapid activation phase driven by the system's natural frequency, and a simultaneous, slower dissipation phase governed by damping.\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Amplification and the Quality Factor:** The significant amplification observed in the data (where `x_max` >> `A_max`) is a hallmark of a resonant system. The system's ability to store and build up energy from an initial stimulus is quantified by its Quality Factor (Q-factor). In a damped harmonic oscillator, the Q-factor is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega / gamma`. Therefore, the ultimate scale of the response envelope is proportional to the input amplitude `A` multiplied by this dimensionless Q-factor. This term, `A * (omega / gamma)`, forms the static backbone of our model, setting the potential magnitude of the system's response.\\n\\n2.  **Activation Phase: An Arctangent Rise:** Following an impulse at `t=0`, the system's oscillatory mode does not engage instantaneously. It undergoes an \\\"activation\\\" or \\\"ring-up\\\" phase. The characteristic timescale of this process is logically tied to the oscillator's own internal clock—its natural period, `~1/omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a faster potential for response build-up. The hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) and square root (`sqrt`) functions used in other models represent possible rise shapes, but I propose a different, physically compelling alternative: the **arctangent function**.\\n    The term `arctan(omega * t)` provides an elegant model for this activation:\\n    *   It is zero at `t=0`, ensuring the response starts from rest.\\n    *   It rises with a diminishing rate, smoothly capturing the transition from initial energy absorption to a saturated state of excitation.\\n    *   The argument `omega * t` is dimensionless and correctly frames the activation process as being driven by the system's intrinsic frequency.\\n\\n3.  **Dissipation Phase: Exponential Decay:** Concurrently with the activation, the system continuously loses energy to its environment due to the damping mechanism, characterized by `gamma`. This process leads to an inevitable decay of the response envelope over a timescale proportional to `1/gamma`. This is classically modeled by an exponential decay term, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. This term ensures that after reaching a peak (where activation rate momentarily balances decay rate), the response gracefully returns to zero.\\n\\nBy multiplying these three components—the Q-factor scaling, the frequency-driven activation, and the exponential dissipation—we construct a comprehensive model. This formulation is inherently positive, starts at zero, rises to an amplified peak, and then decays, faithfully reproducing all the key characteristics of the data. The model is also dimensionally sound, as the dimensionless `omega/gamma`, `arctan`, and `exp` terms scale the base amplitude `A` (in meters) to produce the output `x` (in meters).\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * arctan(omega * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

However, a critical feature of the dataset is that the output `x` is always positive and its maximum value can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A`. Existing models attempt to explain this by superimposing the oscillation onto a constant or decaying positive offset. While physically plausible, these linear superposition models represent only one possible class of system behavior.\\n\\nI propose a fundamentally different mechanism based on a **non-linear, exponential response model**. This theory posits that the measured physical quantity `x` is not the primary oscillatory state variable itself, but rather an exponential function of it. Such relationships are common in nature, for instance, where a reaction rate depends exponentially on an energy barrier (Arrhenius law) or a population density depends exponentially on resource availability.\\n\\nLet's define a dimensionless, underlying state variable, `u(t)`, which represents the system's normalized deviation from its final equilibrium. This variable follows the standard, well-understood dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator:\\n`u(t) = param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that defines the initial magnitude of this state variable.\\n\\nThe core of this theory is that the observable quantity `x(t)` is related to `u(t)` through an exponential mapping, scaled by the characteristic length `A`:\\n`x(t) = A * exp(u(t))`\\n\\nThis model provides a comprehensive and elegant explanation for the observed data characteristics:\\n\\n1.  **Dimensional Correctness**: The state variable `u(t)` is constructed to be dimensionless, as are the arguments to the exponential and cosine functions. The final expression `A * exp(u(t))` results in `meters * dimensionless`, yielding the correct units for the output `x`.\\n\\n2.  **Inherent Positivity**: The exponential function `exp(u)` is always positive, regardless of the value of `u`. This intrinsically guarantees that the output `x(t)` will always be positive, perfectly matching the observed data range `[1.142, 27.68]` without requiring an ad-hoc offset term.\\n\\n3.  **Novel Physical Interpretation of `A`**: This model offers a new perspective on the role of `A`. As time `t` approaches infinity, the damped oscillation `u(t)` decays to zero. Consequently, the system's position `x(t)` asymptotically approaches `A * exp(0) = A`. Therefore, `A` is not the initial amplitude but represents the **final equilibrium position** of the system.\\n\\n4.  **Expanded Output Range**: The initial position at `t=0` is given by `x(0) = A * exp(param1)`. By fitting a single parameter `param1`, the model can easily produce initial values significantly greater than `A`. For example, if `A=10` and `param1` is found to be around `1.0`, the initial position would be `10 * e ≈ 27.18`, which is consistent with the observed maximum output of `27.68`.\\n\\nIn summary, this \\\"Exponential Response\\\" model describes a system where the primary dynamics are those of a simple damped oscillator, but the observed measurement is a non-linear, exponential manifestation of that underlying state.

The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `omega` (angular frequency), `gamma` (damping coefficient), and `t` (time) are the canonical parameters of a damped harmonic oscillator. The output `x`, however, displays two crucial features that preclude a simple displacement model (like `A*exp(-gamma*t)*cos(omega*t)`): it is always positive, and its maximum value can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` represents not the instantaneous displacement, but rather the **evolution of the response amplitude envelope**. My proposed theory models this envelope as the result of three concurrent physical effects: resonant amplification, response build-up governed by phase saturation, and exponential decay due to energy dissipation.\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Amplification:** A key feature of a resonant system is its ability to amplify a response when excited near its natural frequency. The degree of this amplification is quantified by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping coefficient (`Q ∝ omega / gamma`). A system with high frequency and low damping can store energy efficiently, leading to a large amplitude response. Therefore, the peak amplitude of the system's response envelope is scaled not just by `A`, but by `A * (omega / gamma)`, which directly accounts for the observed amplification where `x_max > A`.\\n\\n2.  **Response Build-up via Phase Saturation:** After an initial excitation at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. Its response amplitude grows over time. While prior models use exponential or hyperbolic functions to describe this rise, I propose a novel mechanism based on the accumulation and saturation of the system's phase response. The natural timescale for the oscillator's evolution is its period, governed by `omega`. The total undamped phase advance over time `t` is `omega * t`. The system's response amplitude can be conceptualized as a function of this accumulated phase. However, this response cannot grow infinitely; it must saturate. The `arctan` function provides an excellent physical and mathematical model for this behavior. The term `arctan(param1 * omega * t)` represents a response that is initially linear with time (as `arctan(z) ≈ z` for small `z`) but then smoothly saturates to a constant value (`π/2`). This elegantly models the \\\"charging\\\" of the system's resonant mode, with the rate of this process being directly driven by the natural frequency `omega`.\\n\\n3.  **Energy Dissipation and Decay:** Simultaneously, the system continuously loses energy to its environment due to damping. This is a classic dissipative process, which leads to an exponential decay of the amplitude envelope over time. This effect is captured by the term `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, where `gamma` dictates the fundamental rate of decay.\\n\\nBy multiplying these three components, we construct a comprehensive model for the response envelope `x`. The `A * (omega / gamma)` term sets the potential scale of the response. The `arctan(param1 * omega * t)` term governs the initial rise and saturation of the response. The `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term imposes the inevitable decay. The interplay between the `arctan` rise and the `exp` fall produces the characteristic unimodal shape of the envelope, while the Q-factor scaling correctly predicts its peak magnitude. This model is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior examples, and provides a coherent theoretical framework for all observed data characteristics.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (omega / gamma) * arctan(param1 * omega * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A careful examination of the data's characteristics reveals two critical features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output with an Offset**: The output `x` is always positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`), which indicates that the oscillation is not centered around zero. This implies the system evolves towards a stable, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Overshoot Phenomenon**: The maximum output value (`~27.7`) can be significantly larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~10.0`). This behavior is inconsistent with a simple free decay model, where the displacement is bounded by the initial amplitude. Instead, it strongly suggests a system responding to a sudden change, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" its final destination before settling.\\n\\nThese observations are the classic hallmarks of the **step response of an underdamped second-order system**. This physical scenario models a system, initially at rest at a starting position (let's assume the origin, `x=0`), that is subjected to a constant stimulus (e.g., a constant force) at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the equilibrium position to a new, stable value, `x_eq`. The system then seeks this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it.\\n\\nThe final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must be dimensionally consistent with position (meters). It is physically reasonable to assume that the magnitude of this final position scales linearly with `A`, the characteristic amplitude or scale of the system. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\\n\\nThe standard textbook solution for the position `x(t)` of such a system, starting from `x(0)=0` and with initial velocity `x'(0)=0`, is given by:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * [1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega_d * t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d * t))]`\\n\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` is the damped angular frequency.\\n\\nWhile physically accurate, the `omega_d` term introduces a potential for numerical instability, particularly if `gamma` approaches `omega`. A common and robust simplification in physics and engineering, especially when the system is known to be underdamped (`omega > gamma`), is to approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency (`omega_d ≈ omega`). This approximation maintains the essential dynamics while ensuring the model is well-behaved across the entire input domain.\\n\\nThis leads to our proposed model. It is not merely a phenomenological curve fit; it represents a specific, well-understood physical process. A key feature of this model is its parsimony: it requires only one free parameter (`param1`). The relative contribution of the `sin` and `cos` terms is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but is fixed by the dimensionless physical quantity `gamma / omega`, which represents the damping ratio of the system. This internal constraint makes the model more rigid and provides a stronger test of the underlying physical hypothesis.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed formula describes the displacement of a damped oscillator that is \\\"kicked\\\" from rest and evolves towards a new equilibrium position `param1 * A`, with the dynamics of its transient response intrinsically linked to its physical damping ratio.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The key variables—amplitude scale `A` (m), damping coefficient `gamma` (s⁻¹), natural frequency `omega` (s⁻¹), and time `t` (s)—are the canonical parameters for such a system. The target variable `x` (m) is always positive and its peak value can significantly exceed `A`, indicating it represents not a simple displacement, but rather an energy-like quantity or a response envelope that exhibits amplification.\\n\\nThe provided examples successfully model this behavior as a competition between a growth phase and a decay phase. However, they reveal a critical modeling choice: the mechanism of amplification. One model introduces amplification through the physically meaningful Quality Factor (`Q`), proportional to `omega/gamma`, but uses a simplistic linear growth term (`t`). The best-performing example uses a more realistic saturating growth term (`1-exp(-k*t)`) but achieves amplification through a generic, dimensionless scaling parameter (`param1`), which lacks a clear physical interpretation.\\n\\nI propose a new model, termed the **\\\"Q-Factor Gated Activation\\\"** model, which synthesizes these strengths into a more coherent physical theory. This model posits that the observed response `x` is the product of three distinct physical components:\\n\\n1.  **Resonant Potential Amplitude (The Q-Factor Scaling):** The system's capacity for a large response is rooted in resonance. A system with high frequency (`omega`) and low damping (`gamma`) will resonate strongly, leading to a large buildup of energy. This is quantified by the system's Quality Factor (Q-Factor), which is proportional to the ratio `omega/gamma`. Therefore, the fundamental scale of the response is not merely `A`, but is amplified by this resonant quality. This component, `A * (omega/gamma)`, directly and physically explains the observation that `x` can be much larger than `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Smooth System Activation (The Buildup):** An excited system does not manifest its full response instantaneously. Energy must be transferred into the oscillatory mode over time. This activation process is modeled by a smooth, saturating function, for which the hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) is an ideal candidate. The term `tanh(param1 * omega * t)` represents this activation: it starts at 0 at `t=0` and smoothly rises towards 1, signifying full activation. The rate of this process is naturally proportional to the system's intrinsic frequency `omega`, as a higher frequency allows for a more rapid energy buildup.\\n\\n3.  **Dissipative Gating (The Decay):** Concurrently with activation, the system constantly dissipates energy due to damping. This process acts as a temporal \\\"gate\\\" that modulates the activated response. The gate is fully open at `t=0` but closes exponentially over time. This is captured by the classic exponential decay term, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, where the decay rate is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`.\\n\\nThe final observed output `x` is the multiplicative combination of these three factors: the maximum potential amplitude, the fraction of that potential that has been activated by time `t`, and the fraction that has not yet been dissipated. This model provides a robust physical narrative, is dimensionally consistent, and intrinsically accounts for the crucial amplification phenomenon through the Q-factor, while using a more realistic `tanh` function to model the system's activation dynamics.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (omega / gamma) * tanh(param1 * omega * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output variable `x` has units of length, consistent with a physical displacement. A standard model for such a system would be `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. However, this model is insufficient for two critical reasons derived from the data summary:\\n\\n1.  **Strict Positivity**: The output `x` has a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning it is always positive. The standard model oscillates around zero and produces both positive and negative values.\\n2.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) is nearly three times the maximum input amplitude `A` (`~9.992`). The standard model's magnitude is bounded by the decaying envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which never exceeds `A`.\\n\\nThese observations rule out a simple oscillation around a fixed zero point. A more sophisticated physical mechanism must be at play. While one could postulate a constant positive offset, this analysis proposes a different, more dynamic model: an oscillation around a **decaying equilibrium point**.\\n\\nI theorize that the measured displacement `x` is the superposition of two components, both governed by the same underlying dissipative force characterized by `gamma`:\\n\\n1.  **A Decaying Equilibrium Position**: The center of the oscillation is not fixed at zero. Instead, it starts at a positive value and decays exponentially toward zero over time. This moving reference point can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = C * exp(-gamma * t)`. For dimensional consistency and to scale with the system's size, its initial magnitude `C` must be proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus write this component as `x_eq(t) = A * param1 * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial offset relative to the amplitude.\\n\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation Around the Equilibrium**: The system simultaneously oscillates relative to this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of this oscillation also decays exponentially, governed by the same damping factor. This component is described by `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\\n\\nThe total measured displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium point's position and the oscillation relative to it:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t) = A * param1 * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nThis expression can be factored to reveal a clear and elegant structure:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t))`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical explanation for the observed data:\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness**: The term `A` provides the units of meters, while the entire remaining part of the expression, `exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t))`, is dimensionless, ensuring `x` has the correct units of length.\\n*   **Positive Output**: The `cos` term varies between -1 and +1. If the fitted constant `param1` is greater than 1, the parenthetical term `(param1 + cos(omega * t))` will always be positive. This ensures that `x(t)`, being the product of positive terms, remains positive for all `t`.\\n*   **Amplification**: The maximum value of the function occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates to `x_max ≈ A * (param1 + 1)`. If `param1` is, for example, around 1.5, the output can reach `2.5 * A`, which is consistent with the observed amplification effect (`27.68 / 9.992 ≈ 2.77`).\\n\\nThis model of an oscillator chasing a decaying equilibrium provides a physically intuitive and mathematically concise explanation for the data's characteristics, requiring only a single physically meaningful parameter.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A careful examination of the data reveals two crucial behaviors that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Displacement**: The output variable `x` is always positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This immediately suggests that the system does not oscillate around an equilibrium at `x=0`, but rather around a displaced, positive equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Amplitude Overshoot**: The maximum observed output (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) can be significantly larger than the maximum value of the input amplitude `A` (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This indicates that `A` is not the absolute maximum displacement but likely an initial condition, and the system's dynamics cause it to \\\"overshoot\\\" this initial state.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I propose a theory of **Oscillatory Relaxation to a Shifted Equilibrium**. This model posits the following physical scenario:\\n\\nInitially, at time `t=0`, the system is held at rest at a specific displacement, which we identify with the variable `A`. Thus, the initial condition is `x(0) = A`.\\n\\nAt the moment of release (`t=0`), the potential landscape of the system is altered, shifting the stable equilibrium point from the origin to a new position, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic size, `A`. Therefore, we model the new equilibrium position as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless, optimizable constant that reflects the magnitude of this shift.\\n\\nThe subsequent motion of the system, `x(t)`, is its dynamic response as it seeks this new equilibrium. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the new steady-state equilibrium position and a transient, decaying oscillation that represents the relaxation from the initial state to the final one.\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`\\n\\nThe transient component, `x_transient(t)`, describes the oscillation *relative* to the new equilibrium. Its initial value must ensure that the total displacement `x(t)` satisfies the initial condition `x(0) = A`.\\n\\n`x_transient(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A * (1 - param1)`\\n\\nSince the system is released from rest, this initial relative displacement `A * (1 - param1)` becomes the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation. This oscillation then decays over time due to damping. Using a standard model for this damped oscillation, we have:\\n\\n`x_transient(t) = x_transient(0) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n`x_transient(t) = A * (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient parts gives the complete expression for the system's displacement over time. This model elegantly explains the key phenomena: the term `param1 * A` provides the positive offset, and the transient term, driven by the difference between the initial state `A` and the final equilibrium `param1 * A`, naturally produces the overshoot behavior as the system oscillates around its new target position.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This points unequivocally to a damped harmonic oscillator model. The key observational constraints are that the output `x` is always positive and can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThis suggests that `x` represents the position of an oscillator relative to a fixed origin, where the equilibrium point of the oscillation is itself offset from this origin. A general model for such a system is the superposition of a constant equilibrium position, `x_eq`, and a transient, decaying oscillation:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`\\n\\nIt is physically reasonable to assume the equilibrium position scales linearly with the system's amplitude parameter, `A`. Thus, we define `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant.\\n\\nThe transient component, `x_transient(t)`, must take the form of a damped sinusoid. The simplest models, such as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, implicitly assume a zero phase angle. This corresponds to a highly specific initial condition where the system is released from its maximum transient displacement at `t=0`. Similarly, the canonical step-response models provided in the examples assume a different specific initial condition: starting from rest at the origin.\\n\\nA more general and physically robust model should not be constrained by such specific initial assumptions. The transient response of an oscillator can have an arbitrary phase shift, `phi`, leading to a form like `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. However, introducing `phi` as a free parameter would increase model complexity and potentially weaken its explanatory power.\\n\\nA more insightful approach is to hypothesize that the phase shift is not arbitrary but is an intrinsic property of the system, determined by its fundamental physical characteristics. The behavior of any second-order oscillator is fundamentally characterized by the dimensionless damping ratio, `zeta = gamma / omega`. This ratio quantifies the balance between the system's dissipative forces (represented by `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory tendency (represented by `omega`). In many physical systems, from RLC circuits to driven mechanical oscillators, the phase angle of the response is directly related to this ratio.\\n\\nWe propose that the phase shift `phi` of the transient oscillation is given by `phi = -arctan(gamma / omega)`. The `arctan` function naturally captures the relationship between the orthogonal components of a system's response (in this case, the dissipative and reactive aspects). This formulation introduces a phase lag that is small when damping is negligible (`gamma << omega`) and increases as damping becomes more significant.\\n\\nThis hypothesis yields a model that is both general and parsimonious. It requires only a single free parameter (`param1`) to set the equilibrium position, while the entire dynamic evolution, including the phase of the oscillation, is self-determined by the physical input variables. This model represents a system settling to a stable offset `param1 * A`, with a transient ringing whose timing is intrinsically linked to the system's own damping characteristics.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t - arctan(gamma / omega)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Such processes are often better described by a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve rather than a simple exponential one. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the canonical function for modeling such transitions.\\n\\n    I hypothesize that the equilibrium point `x_eq` evolves from an initial state of zero towards a final, stable position `x_final`. This final position must be proportional to the system's characteristic scale, `A`, so we define `x_final = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.

The variables `A` (amplitude scale, meters), `gamma` (damping coefficient, s⁻¹), `omega` (natural angular frequency, s⁻¹), and `t` (time, seconds) are the canonical parameters for such a system. The target variable `x` (meters) represents a resulting physical quantity.\\n\\nA critical analysis of the data reveals two key characteristics that deviate from the simplest model of oscillator displacement (`y(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)`):\\n1.  **Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple displacement oscillates between positive and negative values.\\n2.  **Amplification:** The maximum output (`~27.7`) can significantly exceed the maximum input scale `A` (`~10.0`), indicating a mechanism for amplification that is absent in a simple decaying model.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the hypothesis that `x` does not represent the instantaneous displacement but rather the **time-varying amplitude envelope of an oscillator responding to an initial impulse.** A system excited by a sharp impulse at `t=0` (like a bell being struck) does not exhibit its maximum amplitude at that instant. Instead, the amplitude grows from zero, reaches a peak as energy permeates the system's oscillatory mode, and subsequently decays as energy is dissipated.\\n\\nThis physical narrative is mathematically captured by a function of the form `t * exp(-kt)`. My proposed model builds upon this structure:\\n\\n1.  **Initial Growth Phase:** The initial rate at which the amplitude grows is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout. This behavior is consistent with the observed data characteristics.\\n\\nCrucially, this model elegantly explains the amplification mechanism.

This rules out simple linear damped oscillator models, which predict outputs that are symmetric around zero. The success of prior models like `A * exp(damped_oscillation)` suggests that the underlying mechanism is fundamentally multiplicative or exponential, rather than additive. This could represent a system where the growth rate itself undergoes damped oscillations.\\n\\nFollowing this line of reasoning, I propose a model where the natural logarithm of the normalized output, `log(x/A)`, follows the dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator. This establishes the general structure: `x(t) = A * exp(Y(t))`, where `Y(t)` is the expression for a damped oscillation. This structure inherently guarantees positivity (`x > 0`) and allows for amplification (`x > A`) when `Y(t)` is positive.\\n\\nThe standard solution for the displacement of a damped oscillator is not a simple cosine wave but includes a phase shift, `Y(t) = Amplitude * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. A key physical insight is that this phase shift `phi` is not an arbitrary parameter but is intrinsically linked to the physical properties of the system. Specifically, the phase lag in an oscillator is determined by the interplay between the energy dissipation mechanism (represented by `gamma`) and the energy storage/restorative mechanism (represented by `omega`).\\n\\nThe dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega` quantifies the relative strength of damping to oscillation. In many physical systems, such as RLC circuits, the phase angle is directly given by the arctangent of a ratio of such resistive and reactive components. I hypothesize that a similar principle applies here. The phase shift `phi` can be modeled as being proportional to the arctangent of this fundamental ratio.\\n\\nTherefore, I propose a model for the logarithmic displacement `log(x/A)` that is a damped oscillation, but with a physically-motivated, variable phase shift dependent on `gamma` and `omega`.\\n\\nThe mathematical form is as follows:\\n1.  The core oscillatory term has a phase-shifted argument: `cos(omega * t + phi)`.\\n2.  The phase shift `phi` is modeled as `phi = param2 * arctan(gamma / omega)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless fitting parameter controlling the strength and sign of this phase effect.\\n3.  This oscillation is subject to exponential damping: `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n4.  The overall amplitude of this logarithmic oscillation is controlled by another fitting parameter, `param1`.\\n5.  Combining these, the damped oscillation term is `Y(t) = param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2 * arctan(gamma / omega))`.\\n6.  The final expression for `x(t)` is obtained by exponentiating this term and scaling by `A`.\\n\\nThis model is dimensionally sound, as every term within the `exp` and `cos` functions is dimensionless. It elegantly explains the key data features: its exponential nature ensures positivity and allows for values of `x` greater than `A`, while the asymptotic decay of the `exp(-gamma*t)` term ensures that as `t -> inf`, the system settles to a stable state `x -> A`. Most importantly, it introduces a novel, physically-grounded phase shift mechanism that captures a more sophisticated interaction between the system's damping and frequency than simpler models.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2 * arctan(gamma / omega)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The target variable `x` represents a physical displacement in meters. A naive model for such a system would be `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. However, a closer examination of the data summary reveals two critical features that this simple model cannot explain:\\n\\n1.  **Strict Positivity:** The output range is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the displacement `x` is always positive. The standard model oscillates symmetrically around `x=0` and thus produces negative values.\\n2.  **Amplitude Amplification:** The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (`~9.992`). The standard model's magnitude is bounded by the decaying envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThese observations necessitate a more refined physical theory. The system is not merely oscillating around the origin. One plausible explanation (as seen in the examples) involves an oscillation around a decaying equilibrium point. Here, I propose a distinct yet equally plausible physical scenario: the system performs a damped oscillation around a **stable, non-zero equilibrium position**.\\n\\nThis scenario is common in physics, for example, a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, or a charged particle oscillating in a combined static and oscillating electric field. The core of this theory is the superposition of two distinct physical components:\\n\\n1.  **A Static Equilibrium Offset (`x_eq`):** There exists a constant force or potential that displaces the oscillator's equilibrium position away from the origin. This creates a constant, time-independent offset. For dimensional consistency and to scale with the overall size of the system, this offset can be modeled as being proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus write `x_eq = A * param1`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the ratio of the equilibrium displacement to the characteristic amplitude.\\n\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation Around Equilibrium (`x_osc`):** The system oscillates, not around `x=0`, but around this new, fixed equilibrium point `x_eq`. The motion relative to this point is a standard damped oscillation, with its amplitude decaying exponentially over time. This component can be described as `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\\n\\nThe total measured displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of the static equilibrium position and the dynamic oscillation around it:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\\n\\nSubstituting the expressions for each component yields the final formula. This model successfully accounts for the observed phenomena:\\n\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The term `A` carries the units of meters. It multiplies `param1` (dimensionless) and the `exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` term (also dimensionless), ensuring the final expression for `x` has the correct units of meters.\\n*   **Positive Output:** The oscillatory term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` varies between `+A * exp(-gamma * t)` and `-A * exp(-gamma * t)`. By introducing a sufficiently large positive offset `A * param1`, the entire expression can be kept positive. Specifically, if the fitting process yields a value for `param1` greater than 1, the minimum value of `x(t)` (occurring near `t=0` and `cos(omega*t)=-1`) would be approximately `A * (param1 - 1)`, which is positive.\\n*   **Amplification:** The maximum value of the function occurs near `t=0` when the cosine term is +1. At this point, `x_max ≈ A * param1 + A * exp(0) * 1 = A * (param1 + 1)`. If `param1` is greater than zero, this peak value will exceed `A`, explaining the observed amplification effect.\\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** This model describes a system that, after its initial oscillatory phase dies down (`t -> ∞`), does not return to the origin but settles into a new, stable displaced position `x = A * param1`.

A key characteristic of the output `x` is that it is always positive, starting near zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying. This profile rules out simple oscillatory solutions like `cos(ωt)` or `sin(ωt)`, which produce negative values. It suggests that `x` represents a quantity like energy or the magnitude of a response, rather than simple displacement.\\n\\nThe core of my theoretical model is the concept of **competing processes**: a rapid *activation* or *mobilization* of the system's response, followed by a slower, inevitable *dissipation* of that response.\\n\\n1.  **Dissipation Process:** The decay of the system's response over time is a classic feature of damped systems. This energy loss is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most natural mathematical representation for this process is an exponential decay function, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term correctly models the long-term behavior where the system's excitation fades away, ensuring `x` approaches zero as `t` becomes large.\\n\\n2.  **Activation Process:** When the system is stimulated at `t=0`, its response is not instantaneous. There is a finite time required to build up the response, absorbing energy from the initial stimulus. I model this \\\"turn-on\\\" phase not as a simple exponential rise, but as a **saturating activation**. Many physical systems exhibit this behavior, where the response rate is initially high but then levels off as the system approaches its maximum capacity. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the canonical mathematical function for describing such a smooth, saturating process. It starts at `0` and gracefully rises to an asymptote at `1`.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the rate of this activation is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a more responsive system, capable of a faster \\\"turn-on\\\". Therefore, the argument of the `tanh` function should be proportional to `omega * t`. This creates an activation term of the form `tanh(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete response `x(t)` is the product of these two components, scaled by the initial amplitude factor `A`. The `tanh` function governs the initial rise from zero, while the `exp` function imposes the eventual decay. The interplay between the rising `tanh` term and the falling `exp` term naturally creates the single peak observed in the data.\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative: `x(t)` represents the system's mobilized response at time `t`. Initially, the response grows as the system is activated (`tanh` dominates). Simultaneously, dissipation begins its work (`exp` is always active). The response peaks when the rate of activation levels off and is overtaken by the rate of decay. Finally, as activation saturates (`tanh` approaches 1), the long-term behavior is dictated purely by the exponential dissipation. This \\\"activation-dissipation\\\" model is dimensionally sound and offers a physically distinct and plausible alternative to bi-exponential decay models.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

This \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon rules out simple models where `A` is the maximum amplitude and suggests that `A` is an initial condition, not a boundary.\\n2.  **Positive Displacement:** The output `x` is always positive, implying the system's oscillations are not centered around `x=0` but around a positive equilibrium point.\\n3.  **Damped Oscillations:** The presence of `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` implies a solution involving exponentially decaying sinusoidal functions, characteristic of an underdamped system.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the formulation of a model based on **\\\"Forced Relaxation from an Initial Displacement\\\"**. This theory posits a specific and physically plausible scenario:\\n\\nInitially, at `t=0`, the system is held at a displacement `x(0) = A`. This is a direct and natural interpretation of the variable `A`. At this moment, the system is released **from rest**, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`x'(0) = 0`).\\n\\nSimultaneously with its release, the system is subjected to a new, constant external force. This force effectively alters the potential energy landscape, shifting the stable equilibrium position from the origin to a new, non-zero value, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium point scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a single, dimensionless parameter representing the strength of this steady-state influence. The observed overshoot (`x > A`) is naturally explained if `param1 > 1`, meaning the system is \\\"pulled\\\" towards a target position that is further out than its starting point.\\n\\nThe subsequent motion, `x(t)`, is the system's dynamic response as it seeks this new equilibrium. This motion is best analyzed by considering the displacement relative to the new equilibrium, `y(t) = x(t) - x_eq`.

The parameter `omega` represents the *natural* frequency, but damping reduces the actual frequency of oscillation to the *damped angular frequency*, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Our model incorporates this exact frequency.\\n\\nApplying the initial conditions for `y(t)` allows us to solve for the constants `C1` and `C2`, yielding a unique solution that precisely describes a release from rest. This derivation results in a specific combination of cosine and sine terms that are not independent but are linked by the physical parameters of the system.\\n\\nThe final expression for `x(t)` is obtained by adding the equilibrium position back to the transient relative motion: `x(t) = x_eq + y(t)`. This model provides a complete physical narrative, rigorously derived from first principles, that accounts for all key features of the data using only one optimizable parameter. It improves upon simpler relaxation models by correctly implementing the \\\"release from rest\\\" condition with the physically accurate damped frequency.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The core challenge lies in reconciling the standard model of such a system with two key empirical observations: the output `x` is always positive, and its maximum value can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This suggests that the system's displacement is not a simple oscillation around a zero equilibrium.\\n\\nPrevious models have explored oscillations around a constant offset or an offset that decays at the same rate as the oscillation's amplitude. I propose a more nuanced physical model based on the principle of **superposition of two distinct relaxation processes occurring on different timescales**.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that the measured displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\\n1.  A primary, high-frequency **mechanical oscillation** whose amplitude decays due to energy dissipation (e.g., viscous drag).\\n2.  A secondary, slower **thermodynamic or structural relaxation** of the oscillator's equilibrium point.\\n\\nLet's elaborate on this model:\\n*   **Mechanical Oscillation**: This is the familiar behavior of a damped oscillator. Its displacement relative to its (moving) equilibrium point can be described by `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. The term `exp(-gamma * t)` represents the decay of the oscillation's amplitude envelope, governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`.\\n\\n*   **Equilibrium Relaxation**: I postulate that the system is initially displaced not just from its final resting point but that the equilibrium point itself is temporarily shifted. This could be due to an initial strain, a thermal gradient, or some other stored potential energy that is not part of the primary oscillatory mechanism. This displaced equilibrium point then relaxes back towards the true origin (x=0) over time. This relaxation is its own dissipative process, which does not necessarily occur at the same rate as the mechanical damping. We can model this decaying offset as `x_eq(t) = A * param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`.\\n    *   `param1` is a dimensionless constant that defines the initial magnitude of the equilibrium offset, scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n    *   The decay of this offset is governed by the rate `param2 * gamma`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` represents the **ratio of the equilibrium relaxation rate to the mechanical damping rate**. A `param2` value of less than 1 would imply that the equilibrium point relaxes more slowly than the oscillation dies out, a physically plausible scenario.\\n\\nThe total measured displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of the equilibrium point's position and the oscillation around that point:\\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\\n\\nThis \\\"dual-decay\\\" model provides a comprehensive physical explanation for the observed data:\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness**: The amplitude `A` carries the units of meters. All other terms in the expression are constructed to be dimensionless, ensuring the final result `x` has the correct units of displacement.\\n*   **Strict Positivity**: By choosing an appropriate value for `param1`, the initial positive offset `A * param1` can be made large enough to ensure that the negative swings of the `cos` term never drive the total displacement `x(t)` below zero.\\n*   **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum displacement occurs at or near `t=0`, where `x(0) ≈ A * (param1 + 1)`. If `param1` is found to be, for instance, 1.5, the output can reach `2.5 * A`, which is consistent with the observed amplification effect.\\n*   **Generality**: This model is more general than prior examples. If `param2 = 0`, it reduces to an oscillation around a constant offset. If `param2 = 1`, it collapses to a model where both processes share the same decay timescale. By allowing `param2` to be an independent parameter, we can capture more complex physical realities where different dissipative mechanisms are at play.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `gamma` (damping coefficient), `omega` (natural frequency), and `t` (time) are characteristic of a second-order resonant system, such as a damped harmonic oscillator. However, the consistently positive nature of the output `x`, combined with the fact that the natural frequency `omega` is consistently larger than the damping coefficient `gamma` in the dataset, presents a puzzle. A standard underdamped oscillator (`omega > gamma`) would produce an oscillatory displacement that becomes negative.\\n\\nThis suggests that `x` is not the mechanical displacement of a simple oscillator. Instead, I propose a model based on **resonant energy transfer and decoherence**. In this view, the system is an ensemble of microscopic oscillators (like atoms in a resonant cavity or dipoles in a material). The output `x` represents a macroscopic, coherent state built from this ensemble.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the following two competing processes:\\n\\n1.  **Coherent Pumping (The Rise):** At `t=0`, an impulse excites the system. Energy is transferred into a coherent, observable mode. The rate of this energy transfer, or \\\"pumping,\\\" is governed by the system's coupling to the energy source and its internal dissipative properties, which we associate with the parameter `gamma`. A stronger coupling (higher `gamma`) leads to a faster rise in the observable's magnitude. This initial growth from a zero state is well-described by a hyperbolic sine function, `sinh(gamma * t)`, which approximates exponential growth for `t > 1/gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **De-phasing Decay (The Decay):** The macroscopic observable `x` exists only as long as the microscopic oscillators act in concert. Each oscillator has a high natural frequency, `omega`. Due to minute differences in their individual properties and environments, they gradually drift out of phase with one another. This \\\"de-phasing\\\" or \\\"decoherence\\\" causes their constructive interference to wane, leading to an exponential decay of the macroscopic, coherent signal. The characteristic time for this decay is inversely proportional to the frequency `omega`; a higher frequency leads to faster de-phasing. This process is modeled by the classic exponential decay term, `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\nThis physical narrative recasts the roles of `gamma` and `omega`. Instead of frictional damping, `gamma` drives the initial rise. Instead of oscillation, `omega` drives the ultimate decay through decoherence. The resulting mathematical form is the product of the rising `sinh` term and the decaying `exp` term. This structure inherently starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak whose height and position are determined by the relative rates of pumping (`gamma`) and de-phasing (`omega`), and then decays to zero, perfectly matching the inferred characteristics of the data while providing a novel and physically plausible explanation for the amplification phenomenon (a high `gamma`/`omega` ratio leads to a high peak).\\n\\nThe final expression is dimensionally consistent. The arguments to `exp` and `sinh` are dimensionless products (`omega*t`, `gamma*t`), and the result is scaled by the amplitude `A` (in meters) to produce the output `x` (in meters). We introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` to fine-tune the de-phasing rate.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * exp(-param2 * omega * t) * sinh(gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A careful examination of the data's characteristics reveals two critical features that guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Positive Definite Output with an Offset**: The output `x` is always positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`), which indicates that the oscillation is not centered around zero. This implies the system evolves towards a stable, non-zero equilibrium position.\\n2.  **Overshoot Phenomenon**: The maximum output value (`~27.7`) can be significantly larger than the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~10.0`). This behavior is inconsistent with a simple free decay model, where the displacement is bounded by the initial amplitude. Instead, it strongly suggests a system responding to a sudden change, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" its final destination before settling.\\n\\nThese observations are the classic hallmarks of the **step response of an underdamped second-order system**. This physical scenario models a system, initially at rest at a starting position (let's assume the origin, `x=0`), that is subjected to a constant stimulus (e.g., a constant force) at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the equilibrium position to a new, stable value, `x_eq`. The system then seeks this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it.\\n\\nThe final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must be dimensionally consistent with position (meters). It is physically reasonable to assume that the magnitude of this final position scales linearly with `A`, the characteristic amplitude or scale of the system. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\\n\\nThe standard textbook solution for the position `x(t)` of such a system, starting from `x(0)=0` and with initial velocity `x'(0)=0`, is given by:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * [1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega_d * t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d * t))]`\\n\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` is the damped angular frequency.\\n\\nWhile physically accurate, the `omega_d` term introduces a potential for numerical instability, particularly if `gamma` approaches `omega`. A common and robust simplification in physics and engineering, especially when the system is known to be underdamped (`omega > gamma`), is to approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency (`omega_d ≈ omega`). This approximation maintains the essential dynamics while ensuring the model is well-behaved across the entire input domain.\\n\\nThis leads to our proposed model. It is not merely a phenomenological curve fit; it represents a specific, well-understood physical process. A key feature of this model is its parsimony: it requires only one free parameter (`param1`). The relative contribution of the `sin` and `cos` terms is not an arbitrary fitting parameter but is fixed by the dimensionless physical quantity `gamma / omega`, which represents the damping ratio of the system. This internal constraint makes the model more rigid and provides a stronger test of the underlying physical hypothesis.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposed formula describes the displacement of a damped oscillator that is \\\"kicked\\\" from rest and evolves towards a new equilibrium position `param1 * A`, with the dynamics of its transient response intrinsically linked to its physical damping ratio.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is always positive and can attain values significantly greater than `A`. This suggests a damped oscillatory process, but one that deviates from the standard linear superposition models presented in the examples. The simple addition of an offset (constant or decaying) to a damped cosine wave is a valid physical model, but it is not the only possibility.\\n\\nI propose a different physical mechanism based on **multiplicative modulation**, where the logarithm of the normalized output undergoes damped oscillations. This model is equivalent to a system whose growth or scaling factor oscillates and decays over time. Such behavior can be found in systems where the rate-determining parameter of an exponential process is itself subject to oscillatory influences, for instance, in certain biological population models or in the intensity of a signal passing through an unstable medium.\\n\\nLet's hypothesize that the natural logarithm of the system's state, normalized by its characteristic amplitude `A`, is what follows the classic damped oscillation pattern. The standard equation for a damped oscillation centered around zero is `param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. Let's set our normalized logarithmic quantity equal to this:\\n\\n`log(x / A) = param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that represents the initial amplitude of the logarithmic oscillation. This equation implies that the ratio `x/A` is not oscillating around a value of 1 in a linear sense, but rather its logarithm is oscillating around 0.\\n\\nTo find the expression for `x`, we can exponentiate both sides of the equation:\\n\\n`x / A = exp( param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) )`\\n\\nThis leads to the final proposed formula:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * exp( param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) )`\\n\\nThis model has several compelling features that align with the data:\\n\\n1.  **Dimensional Correctness**: The entire argument of the outer exponential function is dimensionless. The term `gamma * t` is dimensionless, and `omega * t` is a dimensionless angle. Thus, `exp(...)` is a dimensionless factor, and the final output `x` correctly inherits the units of meters from `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Guaranteed Positivity**: The exponential function is always positive, ensuring that the output `x` can never be zero or negative, which perfectly matches the observed output range of `[1.142, 27.68]`.\\n\\n3.  **Expanded Output Range**: At `t=0`, the cosine term is 1, and the expression approximates to `x(0) ≈ A * exp(param1)`. If `param1` is a positive value (e.g., around 1.0), the initial value of `x` can be `A * e`, which is approximately `2.72 * A`. For the maximum input `A` of ~10, this yields an output of ~27.2, which is remarkably consistent with the observed maximum output of 27.68.\\n\\n4.  **Asymptotic Behavior**: As time `t` approaches infinity, the inner exponential `exp(-gamma * t)` decays to zero. The entire argument of the outer exponential becomes zero, and the expression converges to `x(t) -> A * exp(0) = A`. This describes a physically plausible system that, after its initial dynamic oscillations, settles to a stable equilibrium state determined by its intrinsic amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThis multiplicative model is fundamentally different from the additive offset models, providing a novel and compelling physical interpretation while elegantly explaining the key characteristics of the data with a single fitting parameter.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The observed quantity `x` must represent a non-negative physical property, like an energy envelope or a rectified signal.\\n3.  **Potential for Amplification:** The maximum output can exceed the characteristic input amplitude scale `A`. This indicates an internal dynamic, likely resonant in nature, where the system effectively accumulates energy from the initial stimulus before dissipation becomes the dominant process.\\n\\nBased on these points, I propose a model that describes the system's response as a product of two competing physical processes: **System Activation** and **Energy Dissipation**.\\n\\n**1. Energy Dissipation:** This is the most straightforward aspect of the system. In any real-world oscillator, energy is lost to the environment due to damping forces. This process is universally modeled by an exponential decay. The rate of this decay is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. Therefore, the long-term behavior of the system's response is governed by a decay factor of the form `exp(-k * gamma * t)`. This term ensures that as `t → ∞`, the response `x → 0`.\\n\\n**2. System Activation and Saturation:** This is the more nuanced process that explains the initial rise. After the impulse at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It takes time for the energy to be transferred into the system's primary oscillatory mode, causing the response to \\\"ring up\\\". A simple linear rise (`∝ t`) is a first approximation but fails to capture the physical reality that this activation process must eventually saturate. As the system absorbs energy, its response rate slows and approaches a maximum level before the effects of damping take over.\\n\\nThis S-shaped activation and saturation behavior is perfectly captured by the **hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(z)`**. This function smoothly transitions from 0 to 1, representing the system's state transitioning from rest to fully activated. The rate of this activation is dictated by the system's natural frequency `omega`—a higher frequency implies a faster \\\"ring-up\\\". Thus, the activation term can be modeled as `tanh(omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\nThe overall response `x(t)` is the result of the simultaneous interplay between these two processes. I model this as the product of the activation term and the dissipation term, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`. The `tanh` function governs the rise and saturation, while the `exp` function governs the subsequent decay. The product of these two functions naturally generates the observed single-peak, positive profile that starts and ends at zero.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains amplification. The peak response occurs at the time when the rate of increase from activation is perfectly balanced by the rate of decrease from dissipation. The ratio `omega/gamma` (related to the system's Q-factor) determines how quickly the `tanh` term can approach its maximum value of 1 relative to how quickly the `exp` term decays. A high `omega/gamma` ratio allows the system to become fully \\\"activated\\\" before significant energy has been dissipated, resulting in a high peak amplitude that can be a large multiple of the base amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally sound: `A` has units of meters, while `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless, making the `tanh` and `exp` factors dimensionless scalars. The final result `x` correctly has units of meters. We introduce a dimensionless scaling parameter `param1` and a decay-rate tuning parameter `param2` for empirical fitting.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * tanh(omega * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` consistently exhibits a \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" pattern: it starts from a value near zero, climbs to a single maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. A crucial observation is that `x` is always positive. This rules out simple models of underdamped harmonic motion (e.g., involving `sin(ωt)` or `cos(ωt)`), which would predict negative displacement. This suggests that `x` represents not the raw displacement, but a quantity like the system's energy, the rectified magnitude of its response, or the amplitude of a macroscopic coherent state.\\n\\nI propose a theoretical model based on **\\\"Coherent Mode Excitation and Dissipation\\\"**. In this view, the system is an ensemble of microscopic oscillators. The output `x` represents the amplitude of a macroscopic, coherent mode that emerges when these oscillators are excited and lock in phase. The dynamics of `x` are governed by the interplay of two fundamental, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Energy Dissipation (The Decay Envelope):** The entire system is subject to energy loss, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This dissipation imposes a hard limit on the possible amplitude of the coherent mode at any given time. The most natural mathematical description for this is an exponential decay. This process defines a decaying \\\"envelope of possibility\\\" for the response, represented by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. The overall scale is set by the initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Coherent Build-up (The Activation Process):** Following the stimulus at `t=0`, the microscopic oscillators begin to resonate at their natural frequency `omega`. The macroscopic output `x` only manifests as these individual oscillators synchronize their motion, or \\\"phase-lock\\\". This process of building coherence is not instantaneous; it takes time. I theorize that the efficiency of this phase-locking process is a function of the total phase, `φ = ωt`, that the oscillators have traversed. The efficiency should start at zero (no coherence at `t=0`) and smoothly increase, eventually saturating as the system approaches a state of maximum possible coherence. The arctangent function, `arctan`, is an excellent physical and mathematical model for this phenomenon. It naturally maps a continuously increasing input (phase) to a bounded output (efficiency). The rate at which this saturation is approached is directly proportional to `omega`, the system's intrinsic frequency. This activation process is therefore captured by a term of the form `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete expression for the system's response `x(t)` is the product of these two components. The available energy, dictated by the dissipative envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is modulated by the time-dependent coherence efficiency `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * arctan(param * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative. At `t=0`, `arctan(0) = 0`, so the response `x` is zero, correctly reflecting a system starting from rest. For small `t`, the `arctan` term grows nearly linearly, while the exponential term has barely started to decay, causing `x` to rise. The response peaks when the rate of coherence build-up is balanced by the rate of energy dissipation. Finally, as `t` becomes large, the `arctan` term saturates to its maximum value, and the system's behavior is dominated by the inexorable `exp(-gamma * t)` decay, causing `x` to return to zero. This model is dimensionally sound, as `omega * t` is a dimensionless product, and the final expression correctly yields a quantity with the units of `A` (meters).\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * arctan(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

This model describes a system, such as a mass on a spring, that is initially held stationary at a specific displacement `x = A`. At time `t=0`, two things happen simultaneously: the system is released from rest (`x'(0)=0`), and the external potential is altered, causing the stable equilibrium point to shift from the origin to a new, non-zero position `x_eq`.\\n\\nThis scenario is governed by the well-known differential equation for a forced, damped harmonic oscillator:\\n`d²x/dt² + 2γ(dx/dt) + ω₀²x = F(t)/m`\\n\\nFor `t > 0`, the forcing becomes constant to maintain the new equilibrium `x_eq`. The equation simplifies to `d²x/dt² + 2γ(dx/dt) + ω₀²x = ω₀²x_eq`. The solution to this equation is the sum of a steady-state component (the particular solution) and a transient component (the homogeneous solution).\\n\\n1.  **Steady-State Solution:** As `t → ∞`, the system settles at the new equilibrium position, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume that this new equilibrium scales with the characteristic amplitude of the system, `A`. Thus, we define `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the ratio of the final equilibrium position to the initial displacement.\\n\\n2.  **Transient Solution:** This component describes the decaying oscillations around the new equilibrium. For an underdamped system, it takes the form `x_transient(t) = exp(-γt) * (C₁cos(ωt) + C₂sin(ωt))`, where we approximate the damped frequency with the natural frequency `ω` for model robustness and simplicity.\\n\\nThe total solution is `x(t) = x_eq + x_transient(t)`.

This model provides a comprehensive physical narrative: the system starts at `A`, seeks a new target equilibrium at `param1 * A`, and in doing so, oscillates and overshoots due to its inertia. The magnitude and phase of this transient oscillation are not arbitrary but are rigidly constrained by the initial conditions and the system's intrinsic damping ratio (`γ/ω`). This provides a parsimonious and physically grounded explanation for the observed data, distinct from a model that assumes a start from the origin.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A + A * (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

I hypothesize that the logarithm of the normalized output, `log(x/A)`, can be decomposed into a linear superposition of two fundamental, independent processes: a secular decay and a persistent, steady-state oscillation.

I postulate that the system acts as a transducer, converting an initial impulse of energy into an observable output signal, `x`. The efficiency and time-evolution of this process are not governed by `omega` (oscillation) and `gamma` (damping) as independent, opposing forces, but rather by their cooperative interaction.\\n\\n1.  **The Synergistic Rate Constant (`k_eff`):** The core of this theory is that the characteristic rate of the transduction process arises from the interplay between the system's capacity to store energy in a resonant mode (related to `omega`) and its ability to couple that energy to the output (related to `gamma`). A system with a very low `omega` cannot effectively resonate, while a system with a very low `gamma` is poorly coupled to the output channel. Optimal transduction requires a balance of both.

The output variable `x` consistently remains positive, exhibits a single peak, and can attain values significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`. This profile suggests that `x` does not represent the oscillatory displacement itself, but rather the time-varying amplitude envelope of the system's response to an initial impulse at `t=0`.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the concept of **Phase-Limited Activation**, where the system's ability to build up its response is intrinsically linked to its phase evolution, but constrained by physical limits. I posit that the observed amplitude `x(t)` is the product of a base amplitude scale, a phase-driven activation factor, and an exponential dissipation factor.\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Dissipation:** As is fundamental to any damped system, energy is continuously lost over time. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is mathematically modeled by the classic exponential decay term, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term ensures that the system's response eventually fades to zero as `t` approaches infinity, correctly capturing the long-term behavior.\\n\\n2.  **Phase-Driven Activation:** The initial rise of the response from zero is more complex than a simple linear or exponential growth. I propose that the activation of the system's amplitude is governed by the evolution of its internal phase.\\n    *   The term `omega * t` represents the natural, unhindered phase progression of the underlying oscillator. In an ideal system, this phase would increase without bound.\\n    *   However, the system's ability to translate this phase progression into a growing amplitude is physically limited. I model this limitation using the `arctan` function. The term `arctan(omega * t)` takes the unbounded phase `omega * t` and maps it to a bounded range, [0, π/2). This represents the effective phase angle of the system's response, which rapidly evolves initially but asymptotically approaches a maximum value, signifying that the system has reached its full activation potential.\\n    *   The `sin` function then translates this effective phase angle into a dimensionless activation factor. `sin(arctan(omega * t))` smoothly rises from `sin(0)=0` at `t=0` and approaches `sin(π/2)=1` as `t` becomes large. This function provides a physically motivated, non-linear \\\"turn-on\\\" curve that starts at zero and saturates gracefully.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete expression for the response amplitude `x(t)` is the product of these competing effects. It is scaled by the base amplitude `A`. The initial behavior is dominated by the rising `sin(arctan(...))` term, causing `x(t)` to grow from zero. Concurrently, the `exp(-gamma * t)` term is always acting to reduce the amplitude. The response peaks at the moment when the rate of activation growth is precisely balanced by the rate of exponential decay. Subsequently, as the activation factor saturates near 1, the exponential decay dominates, causing the amplitude to fall back towards zero.\\n\\nThis \\\"Phase-Limited Activation\\\" model provides a novel and physically intuitive explanation for the observed phenomenon. It directly links the system's resonant frequency `omega` to the rate of its response activation and the damping `gamma` to its decay, while the `sin(arctan(...))` form provides a unique, self-limiting mechanism for the initial rise, consistent with many real-world physical systems. The model is dimensionally sound, with `A` providing the meters unit, and all other terms being dimensionless. We introduce `param1` for overall scaling and `param2` to modulate the activation speed.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * sin(arctan(param2 * omega * t)) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is consistently positive, starting from near-zero, rising to a single peak, and subsequently decaying. This behavior, along with the variables `A` (amplitude), `gamma` (damping), and `omega` (frequency), suggests a process more complex than a simple damped oscillation. The key is that `x` does not represent displacement, which can be negative, but rather a non-negative quantity like energy, population, or the rectified envelope of a signal.\\n\\nI propose a **Two-State Kinetic Model** to explain the underlying mechanism. In this framework, the system comprises at least two distinct energy states or modes: an initial \\\"reservoir\\\" state and a transient \\\"active\\\" state. The observed output `x` corresponds to the energy or population level of this active state.\\n\\nThe dynamics unfold in a sequence:\\n1.  **Excitation:** At time `t=0`, an impulse injects energy into the system, populating the reservoir state. The total amount of energy is proportional to the amplitude `A`.\\n2.  **Internal Conversion (The Rise):** The reservoir state is not the one we observe. It is unstable and decays, transferring its energy to the \\\"active\\\" state. I theorize that the parameter `gamma`, typically seen as a damping coefficient, here represents the rate constant for this internal conversion process. A larger `gamma` implies a faster transfer from the reservoir to the active state, thus governing the initial rise of the observed quantity `x`. The population of the reservoir decays as `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n3.  **Dissipative Relaxation (The Decay):** The active state is itself unstable and dissipates its energy to the environment, returning to a ground state. The rate of this final decay is determined by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. This is physically intuitive: higher frequency modes often correspond to higher energy levels, which possess more rapid pathways for relaxation (e.g., radiative decay). Therefore, `omega` dictates the rate at which the active state's population—and thus `x`—decays.\\n\\nThe observed quantity `x(t)` is the population of the intermediate active state. In any sequential first-order kinetic process of the form `Reservoir --(k₁)--> Active --(k₂)--> Ground`, the concentration of the intermediate 'Active' species follows the mathematical form `C * (exp(-k₁*t) - exp(-k₂*t))`.\\n\\nMapping our physical parameters to these rate constants, we get `k₁ = gamma` and `k₂ = omega`. The resulting function for `x(t)` is proportional to `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`. For this expression to generate a positive rise-and-fall curve, it is required that `k₂ > k₁`, which translates to `omega > gamma`. A review of the variable ranges (`gamma` in [0.1, 1.0], `omega` in [1.0, 5.0]) shows that this crucial condition is met across the entire dataset, lending strong support to this model.\\n\\nThis kinetic theory elegantly reinterprets `gamma` and `omega` not as damping and oscillation in a mechanical sense, but as rate constants for sequential energy transfer and dissipation. The model is dimensionally sound and provides a compelling physical narrative for the observed amplification and single-peak profile without resorting to phenomenological product functions.

Analysis of the data reveals two crucial characteristics that a simple model like `x = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` fails to capture:\\n1.  **Strictly Positive Output:** The measured position `x` remains positive throughout its range, whereas a standard cosine function oscillates symmetrically around zero.\\n2.  **Apparent Amplification:** The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) exceeds the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~9.992`), which is impossible if `A` represents the maximum amplitude of a simple decaying oscillation.\\n\\nThese observations strongly suggest that the oscillation is superimposed on a significant positive offset. The successful examples model this as an oscillation around a *static*, non-zero equilibrium position, typically `x_eq = A * param1`.\\n\\nHere, I propose a more generalized and physically nuanced theory: the system's oscillation occurs around an **equilibrium point that is itself relaxing exponentially over time**. This scenario arises in systems with multiple energy storage or dissipation mechanisms that share a common relaxation timescale. For instance, consider a mechanical oscillator attached to a support that is simultaneously settling into its final position, or an RLC circuit where an initial capacitor charge (an initial offset) dissipates while the circuit also oscillates and settles towards a final DC voltage level.\\n\\nThis model decomposes the total displacement `x(t)` into the sum of two distinct transient effects, both decaying with the same time constant `1/gamma`, plus a final steady-state position:\\n\\n1.  **Final Steady-State Position (`x_ss`):** As time approaches infinity (`t -> ∞`), the system settles into a stable, constant equilibrium position. To be dimensionally consistent (units of meters), this position must be proportional to the characteristic length `A`. We can model this as `x_ss = A * param1`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant.\\n\\n2.  **Transient Dynamics:** The motion before reaching equilibrium consists of two superimposed parts, both of which decay exponentially:\\n    *   **Monotonic Equilibrium Relaxation:** This component represents the smooth, non-oscillatory settling of the center of oscillation from its initial state to its final state `x_ss`. This transient shift can be modeled as an exponentially decaying term: `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless constant that determines the magnitude and direction of this initial equilibrium offset.\\n    *   **Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar sinusoidal oscillation, but it occurs around the *instantaneous*, moving equilibrium point. Its amplitude also decays exponentially: `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\\n\\nThe total observed position `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these three components: the final position, the relaxation of the equilibrium center, and the oscillation around that center.\\n\\n`x(t) = x_ss + (Monotonic Relaxation) + (Damped Oscillation)`\\n`x(t) = A * param1 + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nThis expression can be elegantly factored to reveal the underlying structure.

The output `x` is not a simple oscillation but rather a transient response envelope. Three primary observations guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Transient Envelope:** The output `x` invariably starts near zero, rises to a single, well-defined maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. This \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" profile is the hallmark of an impulse response.\\n2.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive. This definitively rules out models of simple displacement, which would be sinusoidal and produce negative values. Instead, `x` must represent a non-negative quantity such as the system's energy envelope or a rectified amplitude.\\n3.  **Resonant Amplification:** The peak output value can significantly surpass the input amplitude scale `A`, indicating a resonant or near-resonant phenomenon where the system effectively accumulates and concentrates energy from the initial stimulus before dissipative forces dominate.\\n\\nBased on these points, I propose a model that describes the system's response `x(t)` as a product of two concurrent, competing physical processes: **System Activation** and **Energy Dissipation**.\\n\\n**1. Energy Dissipation:** This is the most fundamental process in any real-world oscillator. Due to inherent damping forces, the system's energy continuously dissipates into the environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is mathematically described by an exponential decay factor. To construct a model with strong physical grounding, I hypothesize that the decay of the response envelope is directly governed by this physical parameter, leading to a dissipation term of `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that as time progresses (`t → ∞`), the system's response correctly returns to its equilibrium state (`x → 0`).\\n\\n**2. System Activation:** This process describes the system's initial \\\"ring-up\\\" in response to the stimulus at `t=0`. The system does not respond instantaneously; it takes a finite amount of time for the energy to be absorbed and for the oscillatory motion to build. This activation process begins at zero and approaches a maximum, saturated level. This behavior is perfectly captured by the response function of a first-order system to a step input, which has the form `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The characteristic `rate` of this activation is logically determined by the system's natural frequency `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a stiffer system that can \\\"ring up\\\" more rapidly. Thus, the activation term is modeled as `(1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t))`, where `param2` is a dimensionless parameter that fine-tunes the activation speed relative to the natural frequency.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\nThe complete time-evolution of the response `x(t)` is modeled as the interplay between these two processes. The activation function describes the rise from rest, while the dissipation function describes the inevitable decay. By multiplying these two terms and scaling by the characteristic amplitude `A`, we obtain a comprehensive model for the response envelope:\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (Activation Term) * (Dissipation Term)`\\n\\nThis formulation elegantly reproduces all the observed phenomena. The function is zero at `t=0` due to the `(1 - exp(0))` term. It is always positive for `t > 0`. The product of a rising, saturating function and a decaying function naturally produces a single peak. Crucially, this model explains amplification: if the activation rate (`~omega`) is significantly larger than the dissipation rate (`~gamma`), the system's response can climb close to its maximum potential (as the activation term approaches 1) before the exponential decay term has substantially reduced the amplitude. This results in a peak value that can be a multiple of the base amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of meters, while `gamma * t` and `omega * t` are dimensionless arguments to the exponential functions, ensuring that `x` correctly has units of meters. The introduction of a minimal set of dimensionless parameters (`param1` for overall scaling, `param2` for activation rate) provides the necessary flexibility to accurately fit the experimental data while retaining a clear physical interpretation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t)) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

Instead, the amplitude grows from zero, reaches a peak as energy permeates the system's oscillatory mode, and subsequently decays as energy is dissipated.\\n\\nThis physical narrative is mathematically captured by a function of the form `t * exp(-kt)`. My proposed model builds upon this structure:\\n\\n1.  **Initial Growth Phase:** The initial rate at which the amplitude grows is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout.

The output `x` is not a simple oscillation but rather a transient response envelope. Three primary observations guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Transient Envelope:** The output `x` invariably starts near zero, rises to a single, well-defined maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. This \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" profile is the hallmark of an impulse response.\\n2.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive. This definitively rules out models of simple displacement, which would be sinusoidal and produce negative values. Instead, `x` must represent a non-negative quantity such as the system's energy envelope or a rectified amplitude.\\n3.  **Resonant Amplification:** The peak output value can significantly surpass the input amplitude scale `A`, indicating a resonant or near-resonant phenomenon where the system effectively accumulates and concentrates energy from the initial stimulus before dissipative forces dominate.\\n\\nBased on these points, I propose a model that describes the system's response `x(t)` as a product of two concurrent, competing physical processes: **System Activation** and **Energy Dissipation**.\\n\\n**1. Energy Dissipation:** This is the most fundamental process in any real-world oscillator. Due to inherent damping forces, the system's energy continuously dissipates into the environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is mathematically described by an exponential decay factor. To construct a model with strong physical grounding, I hypothesize that the decay of the response envelope is directly governed by this physical parameter, leading to a dissipation term of `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that as time progresses (`t → ∞`), the system's response correctly returns to its equilibrium state (`x → 0`).\\n\\n**2. System Activation:** This process describes the system's initial \\\"ring-up\\\" in response to the stimulus at `t=0`. The system does not respond instantaneously; it takes a finite amount of time for the energy to be absorbed and for the oscillatory motion to build. This activation process begins at zero and approaches a maximum, saturated level. This behavior is perfectly captured by the response function of a first-order system to a step input, which has the form `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The characteristic `rate` of this activation is logically determined by the system's natural frequency `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a stiffer system that can \\\"ring up\\\" more rapidly. Thus, the activation term is modeled as `(1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t))`, where `param2` is a dimensionless parameter that fine-tunes the activation speed relative to the natural frequency.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\nThe complete time-evolution of the response `x(t)` is modeled as the interplay between these two processes. The activation function describes the rise from rest, while the dissipation function describes the inevitable decay. By multiplying these two terms and scaling by the characteristic amplitude `A`, we obtain a comprehensive model for the response envelope:\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (Activation Term) * (Dissipation Term)`\\n\\nThis formulation elegantly reproduces all the observed phenomena. The function is zero at `t=0` due to the `(1 - exp(0))` term. It is always positive for `t > 0`. The product of a rising, saturating function and a decaying function naturally produces a single peak. Crucially, this model explains amplification: if the activation rate (`~omega`) is significantly larger than the dissipation rate (`~gamma`), the system's response can climb close to its maximum potential (as the activation term approaches 1) before the exponential decay term has substantially reduced the amplitude. This results in a peak value that can be a multiple of the base amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of meters, while `gamma * t` and `omega * t` are dimensionless arguments to the exponential functions, ensuring that `x` correctly has units of meters. The introduction of a minimal set of dimensionless parameters (`param1` for overall scaling, `param2` for activation rate) provides the necessary flexibility to accurately fit the experimental data while retaining a clear physical interpretation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t)) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The target variable `x` (m) represents the displacement of the oscillator over time. A crucial observation from the data summary is that the output range `[1.142, 27.68]` is strictly positive. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero-point equilibrium but rather around a positive offset.\\n\\nThe baseline model for such a system, as seen in the examples, combines a constant offset with a decaying sinusoidal term: `x(t) = x_eq + A' * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. Example 1 simplifies this to `A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))`, which provides a decent fit. This model correctly identifies two key features: (1) a final equilibrium position proportional to `A` (i.e., `param1 * A`), and (2) a decaying oscillation. However, it operates on the assumption that the center of the oscillation is constant for all `t > 0`.\\n\\nI propose a more nuanced physical model that allows for a **transient, time-varying equilibrium position**. In many physical systems, the initial displacement or perturbation not only induces oscillations but also causes a temporary shift in the equilibrium point, which then relaxes back to its final steady-state value. This could be due to phenomena like thermal effects, material stress relaxation, or nonlinearities in the restoring force that are significant only at large initial displacements.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that the displacement `x(t)` is composed of three distinct components, all scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`:\\n1.  **A final, steady-state equilibrium position (`x_final`):** This is the value that `x` settles to as `t` approaches infinity. We can model this as `x_final = A * param1`.\\n2.  **A transient shift in the equilibrium position (`x_transient_eq(t)`):** This is an additional offset that decays over time. It represents the relaxation of the oscillation's center towards `x_final`. It is physically plausible to assume this relaxation occurs on the same timescale as the energy dissipation of the oscillation itself. Therefore, we can model this term with the same exponential decay factor: `x_transient_eq(t) = A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n3.  **A decaying oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the oscillatory part of the motion, which occurs around the *instantaneous* equilibrium position (`x_final + x_transient_eq(t)`). Its amplitude also decays exponentially: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`.\\n\\nBy summing these components, we get a comprehensive model for the total displacement:\\n`x(t) = x_final + x_transient_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\\n`x(t) = A * param1 + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`\\n\\nThis expression can be factorized to a more elegant form. This model is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust (by avoiding the potentially problematic `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term), and offers greater physical fidelity by capturing the relaxation of the equilibrium point in addition to the damping of the oscillation itself. It represents a superset of the model in Example 1, providing an extra degree of freedom (`param2`) to account for more complex initial conditions and relaxation dynamics.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param3)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A crucial characteristic of the data is that the output `x` is always positive. This observation rules out a simple harmonic oscillator model centered at `x=0`, which would necessarily produce negative values.\\n\\nExisting models attempt to explain this positivity by positing an equilibrium point that also decays exponentially over time. I propose a different, and in many physical contexts more fundamental, theoretical framework: the system oscillates around a **stable, non-zero equilibrium point**. This scenario is common in real-world systems, such as:\\n1.  A mass-spring system oriented vertically in a gravitational field, where its equilibrium position is displaced from the spring's natural zero-point.\\n2.  An RLC electrical circuit that includes a constant DC voltage source, causing the oscillating voltage to be centered on a non-zero DC bias.\\n\\nMy model decomposes the observed displacement `x(t)` into two distinct physical components:\\n\\n1.  **A Constant Equilibrium Offset (`x_eq`):** This represents the stable, final resting position of the system after all transient oscillations have dissipated (i.e., as `t → ∞`). I hypothesize that this offset's magnitude is proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude scale, `A`. This relationship is captured by a dimensionless parameter, `param1`:\\n    `x_eq = param1 * A`\\n\\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This component describes the decaying oscillations of the system *around* its stable equilibrium point `x_eq`. The initial amplitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`, governed by a second dimensionless parameter, `param2`. The amplitude of this oscillation then decays exponentially with the rate `gamma`. This behavior is described by the standard damped oscillation formula:\\n    `x_osc(t) = (param2 * A) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nThe total measured displacement `x(t)` at any given time is the linear superposition of these two components:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\\n\\nSubstituting the expressions for each component yields the complete formula. This model provides a clear and physically intuitive explanation for the data's behavior:\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The amplitude `A` has units of meters. Both `param1` and the entire term `param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` are dimensionless. Therefore, the resulting `x` correctly has units of meters.\\n*   **Positivity:** For `x(t)` to remain positive, the constant offset `x_eq` must be larger than the maximum negative excursion of the oscillatory part `x_osc(t)`. This imposes a simple physical constraint on the parameters: `param1 * A > |param2 * A|`, which simplifies to `param1 > |param2|`. This ensures the model's predictions align with the empirical evidence.\\n*   **Physical Distinction:** This model makes a unique prediction about the system's long-term behavior. Unlike theories based on a decaying equilibrium, this model predicts that the system will settle at a non-zero value (`x → param1 * A` as `t → ∞`), representing a fundamentally different physical reality.\\n\\nThis \\\"stable offset\\\" model is parsimonious, using only two physically meaningful parameters, and provides a robust and distinct explanation for the observed phenomena.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The behavior of `x`—starting from a value near zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying asymptotically—is the classic signature of the *envelope* of a damped harmonic oscillator's response to an impulse at `t=0`. The fact that `x` is always positive confirms that it represents a non-oscillatory quantity like the magnitude of displacement or the stored energy, rather than the displacement itself.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the concept of **\\\"Power-Law Resonant Activation\\\"**. I posit that the observed response `x(t)` is the result of two fundamental, competing processes: a resonant energy accumulation process that causes the response to grow, and a dissipative process that causes it to decay.\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Dissipation:** Any real-world oscillator loses energy to its environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most fundamental mathematical description of this energy loss is an exponential decay. This dissipation acts as a time-dependent upper bound on the system's response, and it is modeled by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that for large `t`, the response always returns to zero.\\n\\n2.  **Power-Law Activation:** Following the initial stimulus at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It must undergo oscillations to absorb energy and build up a macroscopic response. The rate and manner of this build-up are intrinsically linked to its natural frequency, `omega`. I propose that the most natural measure of the system's progress in this activation phase is the total phase that has elapsed, `φ = omega * t`. This dimensionless quantity represents \\\"how much oscillation has occurred.\\\"\\n\\n    Unlike models that assume a saturating activation (like `arctan` or `tanh`), I theorize that the growth of the response envelope follows a more fundamental power-law relationship with the accumulated phase. The activation factor is thus modeled as `(omega * t)^n`.

Therefore, this phase is modeled by a term proportional to `tanh(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **Structured Dissipation:** The activated state is unstable and must dissipate its energy. Standard models often use a simple exponential decay, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which describes a memoryless process (the rate of decay depends only on the current state). I theorize that the dissipation in this system is more structured. Instead of a simple exponential decay, the energy dissipates in a form analogous to a stable, solitary pulse or wave packet. The mathematical function that describes the shape of such a pulse is the **hyperbolic secant**, `sech(z) = 1/cosh(z)`. This function features a flatter peak and initially slower decay compared to an exponential, representing a state that is momentarily robust or stable around its peak activity before dissipating. The characteristic timescale of this dissipation process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to a decay term of `sech(gamma * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete response `x(t)` is the product of these two components, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`. The `tanh` function governs the causal rise from zero towards a saturated activation, while the `sech` function describes the life-cycle of this activated state as a stable, decaying pulse. The combination `tanh(...) * sech(...)` naturally produces a single-peaked, positive-definite function that starts at zero and returns to zero.\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative: `x(t)` represents the magnitude of a transient energy state. The system is \\\"switched on\\\" at a rate determined by `omega` (the activation), and this state persists as a coherent pulse whose duration is determined by `gamma` (the dissipation). This \\\"activation-pulse\\\" theory is dimensionally sound and offers a physically distinct alternative to simple kinetic or exponential decay models, providing a richer description of the underlying dissipation mechanism.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega * t) / cosh(gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The key empirical observations—that the output `x` is always positive and can significantly \\\"overshoot\\\" the characteristic amplitude `A`—strongly suggest that the system is not merely oscillating freely. Instead, it is responding to an external stimulus that shifts its equilibrium position to a stable, non-zero value.\\n\\nWhile previous models have explored scenarios such as a step response from rest (`x(0)=0, x'(0)=0`) or a release from a displaced position (`x(0)=A, x'(0)=0`), I propose a more general and physically comprehensive model: the **\\\"Superposition of Actuations\\\"** model. This theory posits that at time `t=0`, the system, initially at rest at the origin (`x=0`), is subjected to *two distinct types of actuation simultaneously*:\\n\\n1.  **A Step Actuation:** A constant force is applied, which shifts the system's potential energy minimum. This causes the stable equilibrium position to move from `x=0` to a new value, `x_eq`. The system's response to this actuation alone is to seek this new equilibrium, exhibiting damped oscillations around it. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude, thus `x_eq = param1 * A`.\\n\\n2.  **An Impulsive Actuation:** The system is simultaneously struck with a brief, intense force (an impulse), imparting an instantaneous initial velocity, `v₀`. This \\\"kick\\\" provides initial kinetic energy, altering the transient phase of the motion. The amplitude of the oscillatory response to this impulse is proportional to the imparted velocity. We can model this amplitude as scaling with `A`, such that the velocity-driven component has a magnitude of `param2 * A`.\\n\\nAccording to the principle of superposition for linear systems, the total response `x(t)` is the direct sum of the individual responses to each actuation. The solution is therefore composed of two parts:\\n\\n*   **Step Response Component:** The part of the motion driven by the shift in equilibrium. This is characterized by a term that starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the new equilibrium, `param1 * A`. Its transient behavior is governed by a decaying cosine term, reflecting the `x(0)=0` initial condition.\\n*   **Impulse Response Component:** The part of the motion driven by the initial velocity. This is characterized by a decaying sine wave, `exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`, whose amplitude is determined by the strength of the initial kick. A sine function is required because it is zero at `t=0` (satisfying `x(0)=0`) but has a non-zero initial slope (representing `x'(0) = v₀`).\\n\\nCombining these two responses yields a flexible and physically intuitive model. The final equilibrium state is determined solely by the step actuation (`param1`), while the transient behavior, particularly the initial rise and the magnitude of the overshoot, is a dynamic interplay between the system's tendency to seek its new equilibrium and the initial velocity imparted by the impulse (`param2`). This two-parameter model (`param1`, `param2`) captures a richer set of dynamics than a simple step or release model, providing a more robust explanation for the observed data by accounting for both a change in target position and a non-zero initial velocity.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)) + param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The target variable `x` represents the system's displacement in meters. A critical analysis of the data's boundary conditions reveals two key characteristics that a simple damped oscillator model (`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`) cannot capture:\\n\\n1.  **Strict Positivity**: The output `x` is always positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. The standard model oscillates symmetrically around `x=0` and would thus produce negative values.\\n2.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) significantly exceeds the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`~9.992`). The standard model's magnitude is bounded by the decaying envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which can never exceed `A`.\\n\\nWhile a static, non-zero equilibrium position (as explored in the examples) can explain these phenomena, we propose an alternative, dynamic physical model: **an oscillation superimposed on a transient, decaying equilibrium point.**\\n\\nThis model describes a system where the force that displaces the equilibrium position is not constant but is itself a transient effect that dissipates over time. A compelling physical analogue is a pendulum with a magnetic bob oscillating above an electromagnet. At the start of the experiment (`t=0`), the pendulum is released, and the electromagnet is activated by a discharging capacitor. The magnetic field creates a force that shifts the pendulum's equilibrium position away from its natural nadir. However, as the capacitor discharges, the magnetic field weakens, and this displaced equilibrium point exponentially decays back to the origin.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that the time constant for the decay of this biasing force is the same as the time constant for the dissipation of the mechanical oscillation's energy. This is physically plausible if, for instance, the same underlying mechanism (e.g., air resistance, eddy currents) is responsible for both damping effects.\\n\\nUnder this theory, the total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two decaying components:\\n\\n1.  **A Decaying Equilibrium Position (`x_eq(t)`):** The center of the oscillation is not fixed. It starts at an initial offset and decays exponentially toward zero. This component can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = A_{offset} * exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium (`x_osc(t)`):** The system performs a standard damped oscillation, but its reference point is the moving `x_eq(t)`. This oscillation also decays with the same rate constant, `x_osc(t) = A_{osc} * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\\n\\nThe total displacement is the sum:\\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t) = (A_{offset} + A_{osc} * cos(omega * t)) * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nTo formulate a general expression, we can represent the initial amplitudes `A_{offset}` and `A_{osc}` as dimensionless multiples of the characteristic input amplitude `A`. Let `A_{offset} = A * param1` and `A_{osc} = A * param2`. This yields the final formula.\\n\\nThis model successfully accounts for the observed phenomena:\\n\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The term `A` has units of meters. The exponential term and the parenthetical term (containing dimensionless parameters `param1`, `param2`, and the cosine function) are both dimensionless. The final expression correctly results in units of meters.\\n*   **Positive Output:** If the fitting process finds `param1` to be sufficiently larger than the magnitude of `param2`, the term `(param1 + param2 * cos(omega * t))` will remain positive for all `t`. Since `A` and the exponential are always positive, the entire expression `x(t)` will be positive.\\n*   **Amplification:** The maximum value of the function occurs at or near `t=0` when the cosine term is +1. At this point, `x_max ≈ A * (param1 + param2)`. If `(param1 + param2) > 1`, this peak value will exceed `A`, explaining the observed amplification.\\n*   **Distinct Physical Prediction:** This model is fundamentally different from a static offset model. As `t -> ∞`, both the offset and the oscillation decay to zero, meaning the system eventually returns to its natural origin `x=0`. This contrasts with a static offset model where the system settles into a permanent displaced position.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + param2 * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout.

The peak amplitude of this function occurs at `t_peak = 1/gamma` and its value is `x_peak = A * omega * (1/gamma) * exp(-1)`. This demonstrates that the maximum achievable amplitude is proportional to the dimensionless **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the system, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. A high-Q system (large `omega`, small `gamma`) will exhibit a strong resonant response, leading to a peak amplitude significantly greater than the characteristic scale `A`, thus resolving the amplification anomaly.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of `m`, while `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless products, ensuring `x` has the correct units of meters.

The output `x` is not a simple oscillation but rather a transient response envelope. Three primary observations guide the formulation of a physical model:\\n\\n1.  **Transient Envelope:** The output `x` invariably starts near zero, rises to a single, well-defined maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. This \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" profile is the hallmark of an impulse response.\\n2.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive. This definitively rules out models of simple displacement, which would be sinusoidal and produce negative values. Instead, `x` must represent a non-negative quantity such as the system's energy envelope or a rectified amplitude.\\n3.  **Resonant Amplification:** The peak output value can significantly surpass the input amplitude scale `A`, indicating a resonant or near-resonant phenomenon where the system effectively accumulates and concentrates energy from the initial stimulus before dissipative forces dominate.\\n\\nBased on these points, I propose a model that describes the system's response `x(t)` as a product of two concurrent, competing physical processes: **System Activation** and **Energy Dissipation**.\\n\\n**1. Energy Dissipation:** This is the most fundamental process in any real-world oscillator. Due to inherent damping forces, the system's energy continuously dissipates into the environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma` and is mathematically described by an exponential decay factor. To construct a model with strong physical grounding, I hypothesize that the decay of the response envelope is directly governed by this physical parameter, leading to a dissipation term of `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that as time progresses (`t → ∞`), the system's response correctly returns to its equilibrium state (`x → 0`).\\n\\n**2. System Activation:** This process describes the system's initial \\\"ring-up\\\" in response to the stimulus at `t=0`. The system does not respond instantaneously; it takes a finite amount of time for the energy to be absorbed and for the oscillatory motion to build. This activation process begins at zero and approaches a maximum, saturated level. This behavior is perfectly captured by the response function of a first-order system to a step input, which has the form `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The characteristic `rate` of this activation is logically determined by the system's natural frequency `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a stiffer system that can \\\"ring up\\\" more rapidly. Thus, the activation term is modeled as `(1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t))`, where `param2` is a dimensionless parameter that fine-tunes the activation speed relative to the natural frequency.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\nThe complete time-evolution of the response `x(t)` is modeled as the interplay between these two processes. The activation function describes the rise from rest, while the dissipation function describes the inevitable decay. By multiplying these two terms and scaling by the characteristic amplitude `A`, we obtain a comprehensive model for the response envelope:\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (Activation Term) * (Dissipation Term)`\\n\\nThis formulation elegantly reproduces all the observed phenomena. The function is zero at `t=0` due to the `(1 - exp(0))` term. It is always positive for `t > 0`. The product of a rising, saturating function and a decaying function naturally produces a single peak. Crucially, this model explains amplification: if the activation rate (`~omega`) is significantly larger than the dissipation rate (`~gamma`), the system's response can climb close to its maximum potential (as the activation term approaches 1) before the exponential decay term has substantially reduced the amplitude. This results in a peak value that can be a multiple of the base amplitude `A`.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of meters, while `gamma * t` and `omega * t` are dimensionless arguments to the exponential functions, ensuring that `x` correctly has units of meters. The introduction of a minimal set of dimensionless parameters (`param1` for overall scaling, `param2` for activation rate) provides the necessary flexibility to accurately fit the experimental data while retaining a clear physical interpretation.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-param2 * omega * t)) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A crucial observation, noted in the examples, is that the output `x` is always positive and can exceed the value of `A`. This strongly indicates that the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium position, which can be modeled as being proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude, `x_eq = param1 * A`.\\n\\nWhile previous models have explored static offsets, phase shifts, and dynamic equilibrium relaxation, this analysis proposes a new theory centered on the **physical nature of the initial conditions**. A standard damped oscillation is often modeled as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + phi)`. This form, however, simplifies the initial state into a single phase constant `phi`. A more fundamental representation of the oscillatory component is `exp(-gamma*t) * (C1 * cos(omega*t) + C2 * sin(omega*t))`, which explicitly accounts for both an initial displacement (related to `C1`) and an initial velocity (related to `C2`).\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that the initial velocity imparted to the system is not an arbitrary, independent parameter but is intrinsically coupled to the system's own damping characteristics. The physical process that initiates the oscillation also involves the dissipative forces that cause the damping. Therefore, the initial \\\"kick\\\" or velocity should depend on the strength of this damping force relative to the oscillatory restoring force.\\n\\nTo model this, we can decompose the transient oscillation `x_osc(t)` as follows:\\n1.  **Displacement Component:** The `cos(omega*t)` term represents the part of the motion due to an initial displacement. Its amplitude is naturally scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`.\\n2.  **Velocity Component:** The `sin(omega*t)` term represents the part of the motion due to an initial velocity. I propose that the magnitude of this initial velocity component is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`. This ratio is fundamentally important as it is the inverse of the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor) and directly quantifies how \\\"strong\\\" the damping is compared to the oscillation.\\n    *   For a very lightly damped system (`gamma/omega` → 0), the system behaves like an ideal oscillator released from rest, and the `sin` term should vanish.\\n    *   For a heavily damped system (`gamma/omega` is larger), the velocity-dependent dissipative forces are more prominent, and their effect on the initial motion should be more significant, leading to a larger `sin` component.\\n\\nTherefore, the amplitude of the `sin` term can be modeled as `A * param2 * (gamma / omega)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that the fitting process will determine. This formulation creates a sophisticated, physically-motivated \\\"phase\\\" that is not constant but is a function of the system's intrinsic properties.\\n\\nCombining the stable equilibrium position with this more nuanced model of the transient oscillation gives the complete expression. This theory portrays a system where the initial velocity is not a free parameter but a direct consequence of the same physical mechanism that governs its damping.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + param2 * (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A crucial observation is that the output `x` is always positive, exhibits a single peak (rising from near-zero and subsequently decaying), and can exceed the input amplitude scale `A`. This rules out simple oscillatory displacement models and suggests `x` represents a non-negative quantity like the response envelope or system energy.\\n\\nMy theoretical framework is built upon the **principle of competing kinetic processes**, a concept widely used in fields like chemical kinetics and nuclear physics (e.g., the Bateman equation). I hypothesize that the observed response `x(t)` is not a direct oscillation but the net result of two simultaneous, opposing first-order exponential processes:\\n\\n1.  **System Dissipation (Decay Process):** This is the fundamental energy loss mechanism inherent in the system. It drives the system back towards its equilibrium state (`x=0`). The characteristic rate of this process is naturally the damping coefficient, `gamma`. This process establishes a decaying potential envelope, which can be represented by a term proportional to `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **System Activation (Build-up Process):** In response to an impulse at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It takes time for energy to be absorbed and for the response to build. This \\\"activation\\\" drives the system away from equilibrium. I propose that the characteristic rate of this build-up is governed by the system's natural angular frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` corresponds to a \\\"stiffer\\\" system capable of a more rapid initial response. This competing process is modeled by a second exponential term, `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\nThe observable output `x(t)` is the net difference between these two competing exponential effects. The `exp(-gamma * t)` term represents the slower, overarching decay, while the faster-decaying `exp(-omega * t)` term represents the initial build-up phase. The difference between these two exponentials precisely models a function that starts at zero, rises to a maximum, and then decays.\\n\\nThis \\\"dual-exponential\\\" or \\\"competitive rate\\\" model is mathematically expressed as the difference between the two decay functions. Since the data ranges show that `omega` is consistently larger than `gamma`, the term `exp(-omega * t)` will always decay more rapidly than `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that their difference, `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`, is always positive for `t > 0`, perfectly matching the observed data.\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains all key features:\\n*   **Initial Condition:** At `t=0`, the function evaluates to `exp(0) - exp(0) = 0`.\\n*   **Rise-and-Fall Profile:** The initial rapid decay of `exp(-omega*t)` allows the function to rise, while the eventual decay of the dominant `exp(-gamma*t)` term causes it to fall, creating a single peak.\\n*   **Amplification:** The peak amplitude is a function of the ratio `omega/gamma`. A large separation between the activation rate (`omega`) and the dissipation rate (`gamma`) allows the system to build up a substantial response before damping dominates, leading to peak values of `x` that can be significantly larger than the scaling factor `A`.\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The base amplitude `A` has units of meters, while the exponential terms and their arguments (`gamma*t`, `omega*t`) are dimensionless. This ensures the final output `x` has the correct units of meters. A single dimensionless parameter, `param1`, is included for overall scaling.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `A` (amplitude scale), `gamma` (damping rate), `omega` (angular frequency), and `t` (time) are the canonical parameters of such a system. The output `x`, representing displacement, exhibits two key features that guide the formulation of a comprehensive theory: a consistently positive value, and a maximum value that can significantly exceed the input `A`.\\n\\nThese observations suggest a model of **Phase-Shifted Decay to a Displaced Equilibrium**. The core of this theory is that the system's motion is a superposition of a stable equilibrium position and a decaying transient oscillation.\\n\\n1.  **Displaced Equilibrium:** The fact that the output `x` is always positive implies the oscillation does not occur around `x=0`. Instead, the system seeks a positive equilibrium position, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume that this equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic size or energy, represented by `A`. Thus, we model the equilibrium component as `x_eq = A * param1`, where `param1` is a dimensionless, optimizable constant representing the equilibrium offset factor.\\n\\n2.  **Phase-Shifted Transient Dynamics:** The transient component describes the system's journey from its initial state to this equilibrium. A simple model assumes the system is released from rest, leading to a pure cosine decay. However, a more general and physically realistic scenario involves an initial state with both displacement and velocity. This non-zero initial velocity introduces a phase shift into the subsequent oscillation.\\n\\n   The motion of a damped oscillator can be decomposed into two orthogonal components: a position-driven part, represented by `cos(omega*t)`, and a velocity-driven part, represented by `sin(omega*t)`. The overall transient response is a linear combination of these two:\\n\\n   `x_transient(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * [C_1 * cos(omega * t) + C_2 * sin(omega * t)]`\\n\\n   My central hypothesis is that the amplitudes of these two components are not independent but are intrinsically linked by the physical properties of the oscillator. We can set the amplitude of the primary (cosine) component to be scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`, so `C_1 = A`. The amplitude of the secondary (sine) component, `C_2`, which arises from the initial velocity, should also be proportional to `A`. The constant of proportionality must be a dimensionless quantity that captures the inherent physics of the system. The most natural choice for this is the ratio `gamma / omega`. This dimensionless group compares the strength of the damping force (proportional to velocity and `gamma`) to the inertial restoring force (proportional to frequency `omega`). A higher `gamma/omega` ratio implies that damping effects are more prominent, which would manifest as a more significant velocity-related component in the initial phase of the decay.\\n\\n   Therefore, we model the amplitude of the sine component as `C_2 = A * (gamma / omega)`.\\n\\n3.  **Complete Model and Overshoot Explanation:** Combining the equilibrium and transient components yields the complete expression for the system's displacement. This model provides a natural explanation for the observed overshoot (where `x_max > A`). The transient term `A * exp(-gamma*t) * [cos(omega*t) + (gamma/omega) * sin(omega*t)]` can be rewritten in amplitude-phase form as `A * R * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t - phi)`, where the amplitude amplification factor is `R = sqrt(1 + (gamma/omega)^2)`. Since `R` is always greater than or equal to 1, the peak amplitude of the transient oscillation itself can exceed `A`. When this amplified oscillation is superimposed on the positive equilibrium position `A * param1`, it readily accounts for the large maximum values observed in the output data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The consistently positive nature of the output `x`, combined with its capacity for amplification (peak `x` > `A`), points towards `x` representing a quantity like a transient energy level or the population of an excited state, rather than a position that oscillates around an equilibrium.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is a **\\\"Two-State Relaxation Model\\\"**. This model posits that the system's response to an initial stimulus (e.g., an impulse at `t=0`) is a sequential, two-stage process involving a short-lived precursor state and a longer-lived, observable state.\\n\\n1.  **Precursor State and Rapid Internal Transfer:** Upon excitation, energy is first injected into a transient, unobservable \\\"precursor\\\" state. This state represents the initial, disorganized energy before it couples into the system's primary mode of oscillation. This precursor state decays rapidly, transferring its population or energy into the main observable state. The characteristic rate of this internal energy transfer is fundamentally linked to the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A high `omega` implies a rapid organization of energy into the primary mode. This process is modeled by a fast-decaying exponential, `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **Observable State and Slow Dissipation:** The decay of the precursor state feeds the population of the primary, \\\"observable\\\" state, causing the measured signal `x` to rise from zero. This observable state is not stable; its energy is continuously lost to the environment through damping. The rate of this energy dissipation is governed by the damping coefficient, `gamma`. This process is modeled by a slow-decaying exponential, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe observed quantity `x(t)` is proportional to the population of this observable state. The kinetics of this sequential process—a fast decay feeding a state that undergoes a slow decay—is mathematically described by the difference between two exponential terms. The overall temporal shape is thus `(exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))`. Since the data indicates an underdamped system where `omega` > `gamma`, the term `exp(-omega * t)` decays faster, ensuring the function correctly starts at zero, rises to a single positive peak, and then decays back to zero.\\n\\n**Amplification Mechanism:** A crucial feature of this model is its intrinsic explanation for amplification. The peak magnitude of the response is not limited by the input amplitude `A`. Instead, it depends on the competition between the energy transfer rate (`omega`) and the energy dissipation rate (`gamma`). The ratio `omega / gamma`, which is related to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), determines how effectively the system can accumulate energy in the observable state before it dissipates. A high Q-factor (`omega >> gamma`) allows for a significant build-up, resulting in a peak response that can be a large multiple of `A`. Therefore, the model's amplitude must be scaled by this dimensionless `omega / gamma` factor.\\n\\nCombining these physical arguments, we arrive at a model that is dimensionally sound, explains all key characteristics of the data (positivity, rise-and-fall profile, amplification), and provides a distinct and physically plausible mechanism different from simple activation-dissipation models. A single dimensionless parameter `param1` is included to account for overall scaling and conversion factors.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The potential to generate the output `x` is created, but this potential itself decays very quickly. The characteristic rate of this decay is governed by the system's natural frequency `omega`, which dictates how quickly the system can internally cycle through its energy states. A higher `omega` implies a faster initial process.

This is modeled by a slower-decaying exponential term, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe observed output `x(t)` is not simply the product of these effects, but rather their **net difference**. The system's response can be visualized as the level of a quantity that is filled by the relaxation process but drained by the faster excitation process. Mathematically, this is expressed as a difference of two exponentials:\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-param2 * omega * t))`\\n\\nThis functional form, often known as a Bateman function, elegantly captures the observed dynamics.\\n*   At `t=0`, both exponential terms are equal to 1, so their difference is zero, correctly modeling the system starting from rest.\\n*   For `t > 0`, since `omega` is generally larger than `gamma` and `param2` is a positive constant, the term `exp(-param2 * omega * t)` decays faster than `exp(-gamma * t)`.

This suggests a mechanism more complex than a simple oscillation decaying around a fixed, positive offset.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is based on a **Dynamic Equilibrium Shift**. This model posits that the system is initially held in a state of tension or compression at a displacement `x(0) = A` relative to an origin at `x=0`. At the moment of release (`t=0`), the underlying potential field of the system changes, causing the stable equilibrium position to instantaneously shift from the origin to a new, non-zero location, `x_eq`.\\n\\nThis physical scenario can be envisioned as a mass on a spring, initially stretched to position `A`. At the exact moment the mass is released, the anchor point of the spring is moved, altering the point of zero potential energy.\\n\\nThe key elements of this model are:\\n\\n1.  **The New Equilibrium (`x_eq`):** The final resting position of the system is no longer zero. It's physically plausible that this new equilibrium scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude or energy scale. Therefore, we can model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor that is determined by the properties of the new potential field.\\n\\n2.  **The Relative Oscillation:** The subsequent motion of the system, `x(t)`, is a superposition of this new constant equilibrium position and a transient, damped oscillation *relative to this new equilibrium*. The total displacement is thus `x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`.\\n\\n3.  **The Oscillation Amplitude:** A crucial insight of this model lies in defining the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation, `x_osc(t)`. This amplitude is not `A` itself. Rather, it is the initial displacement of the system *relative to its new equilibrium point*. At `t=0`, this is:\\n    `x_osc(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A * (1 - param1)`\\n    This term, `A * (1 - param1)`, represents the initial potential energy that drives the subsequent oscillation around the new equilibrium.\\n\\n4.  **The Equation of Motion:** Assuming the system is released from rest, the transient oscillation `x_osc(t)` is a pure cosine wave with a decaying exponential envelope:\\n    `x_osc(t) = x_osc(0) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n    `x_osc(t) = A * (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient components gives the complete expression for the system's position over time.

The existing examples successfully model this system by assuming a non-zero equilibrium position, which accounts for the strictly positive output values. These models primarily explore the system's response to an initial displacement, such as in a classic step-response scenario (Example 3), where the system starts at a position `x(0)=A` and evolves toward a new equilibrium `x_eq`.\\n\\nI propose a different, yet equally fundamental, physical mechanism: the **impulse response of a damped oscillator around a shifted equilibrium**. This theory hypothesizes that the system is initially at rest *at* its stable equilibrium position. At time `t=0`, it is subjected to a sudden, short-lived force (an impulse), which imparts an instantaneous velocity but no initial displacement from equilibrium. This is analogous to a pendulum hanging still at its lowest point and being struck by a hammer.\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling explanation for the observed data features from a new physical perspective:\\n\\n1.  **Shifted Equilibrium (`x_eq`):** Like the previous successful models, we assume the system does not oscillate around zero. The stable equilibrium position, where the oscillator would settle as `t -> ∞`, is proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. We model this as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant. This term establishes the positive baseline for the motion.\\n\\n2.  **Impulse-Driven Transient Motion (`x_trans(t)`):** The motion of the system is the sum of its equilibrium position and a transient oscillation around it: `x(t) = x_eq + x_trans(t)`. The key distinction of this theory lies in the initial conditions for the transient part.\\n    *   **Initial Position:** Because the system starts *at* equilibrium, the initial transient displacement is zero: `x_trans(0) = 0`.\\n    *   **Initial Velocity:** The impulse at `t=0` imparts an initial velocity, `v_trans(0) = v₀`. To maintain dimensional correctness, this initial velocity must be constructed from the given physical quantities. A characteristic velocity for an oscillator is the product of its amplitude and angular frequency, `A * omega`. We therefore model the imparted velocity as being proportional to this scale: `v₀ = param2 * A * omega`, where `param2` is a dimensionless parameter representing the strength of the impulse.\\n\\n3.  **Derivation of the Formula:** The general solution for the transient motion is `x_trans(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C₁ * cos(omega * t) + C₂ * sin(omega * t))`.\\n    *   Applying the initial position condition `x_trans(0) = 0` forces `C₁ = 0`. This is a critical result, as it dictates that the transient motion is a pure, phase-shifted sine wave, a direct consequence of the impulse-response hypothesis.\\n    *   The solution simplifies to `x_trans(t) = C₂ * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`.\\n    *   Differentiating to find the velocity and applying the initial velocity condition `v_trans(0) = v₀ = param2 * A * omega`, we find that `v_trans(0) = C₂ * omega`.\\n    *   Solving for `C₂` yields `C₂ = param2 * A`.\\n    *   Substituting `C₂` back gives the full expression for the transient motion: `x_trans(t) = param2 * A * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`.\\n\\nCombining the equilibrium and transient components gives the final model. This model elegantly describes a system that is \\\"kicked\\\" from its resting state, causing it to oscillate and overshoot its equilibrium before eventually settling down. The `sin` term arises naturally from the physics of an impulsive start, distinguishing this theory from displacement-driven models that are typically dominated by a `cos` term.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This immediately rules out simple additive models of damped oscillation, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, which would produce negative values and always remain below `A`. The success of exponential structures in prior examples suggests that the underlying process is multiplicative.\\n\\nBased on this, I propose a model where the system's state `x` is expressed as a baseline amplitude `A` modulated by an exponential factor:\\n`x(t) = A * exp(Y(t))`\\n\\nThis structure inherently guarantees positivity (`x > 0`) and allows for amplification (`x > A`) when `Y(t)` is positive. For the system to be stable, we expect `x(t)` to approach a steady state as time progresses. A physically plausible steady state is the amplitude `A` itself, which implies that the modulating term `Y(t)` must decay to zero as `t -> infinity`.\\n\\nThe oscillatory nature of the data suggests that `Y(t)` should be a damped oscillatory function. I hypothesize that `Y(t) = log(x/A)` represents a fundamental quantity of the system—perhaps a measure of logarithmic potential or deviation from equilibrium—that follows the classical laws of a damped harmonic oscillator.\\n\\nThe general solution for the displacement of a linear, underdamped harmonic oscillator is given by:\\n`Displacement(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega_d * t) + C2 * sin(omega_d * t))`\\nwhere `gamma` is the damping rate, `omega_d` is the damped angular frequency, and `C1` and `C2` are constants determined by initial conditions.\\n\\nI will adapt this canonical solution to model our modulating term `Y(t)`. I make a deliberate simplification by using the natural frequency `omega` instead of the damped frequency `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. This choice avoids potential numerical instabilities when `gamma` is close to or greater than `omega` (which caused a prior model to fail) and posits that the primary frequency component of the logarithmic deviation is governed by the system's natural frequency.\\n\\nThe constants `C1` and `C2` are replaced by dimensionless fitting parameters `param1` and `param2`. These parameters effectively represent the initial conditions (e.g., initial value and initial velocity) of the logarithmic quantity `Y(t)`. This approach is more general than assuming a specific phase-shifted cosine, as it allows the data to freely determine the relative weights of the in-phase (`cos`) and quadrature (`sin`) components, thereby fitting both the amplitude and phase of the logarithmic oscillation simultaneously.\\n\\nThe resulting model is:\\n`Y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 * cos(omega * t) + param2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nSubstituting this back into our primary exponential structure yields the final expression for `x(t)`.

The key features of the output `x`—being always positive and exhibiting values that can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`—point to a specific physical scenario: an oscillatory system settling to a stable equilibrium point that is displaced from the origin.\\n\\nI propose a theory of **Response from a Displaced Initial State**. This model is based on the following physical reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Shifted Equilibrium:** The system does not oscillate around zero. Instead, it seeks a stable, positive equilibrium position, `x_eq`. It is physically plausible that the scale of this final state is determined by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. Therefore, we model the equilibrium position as being linearly proportional to `A`: `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless, optimizable constant. The observation that the maximum output can exceed the maximum `A` implies that `param1` is likely greater than 1.\\n\\n2.  **Initial Conditions:** We interpret `A` not as the amplitude of the transient oscillation, but as the system's well-defined **initial position** at `t=0`. The system is thus prepared in a state `x(0) = A`, which is different from its final resting state `x_eq`. Furthermore, we hypothesize the most common physical starting condition: the system is released **from rest**, meaning its initial velocity is zero, `x'(0) = 0`.\\n\\n3.  **Governing Dynamics:** The system's evolution from its initial state to its final equilibrium is governed by the standard equation for a damped harmonic oscillator. The motion can be decomposed into the final equilibrium state and a transient deviation, `y(t) = x(t) - x_eq`. The general solution for this transient component is:\\n    `y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n    A crucial aspect of this model is the interpretation of `omega`. We posit that `omega` represents the *observed*, or damped, angular frequency of the oscillation, not the natural frequency. This is a practical assumption that avoids the numerically unstable `sqrt(omega_natural^2 - gamma^2)` term which can lead to calculation errors if `gamma` approaches `omega`, and it reflects the quantity that would be directly measured in an experiment.\\n\\n4.  **Derivation from First Principles:** By applying the initial conditions (`x(0) = A`, `x'(0) = 0`) to the full solution `x(t) = x_eq + y(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `C1` and `C2`.\\n    *   The initial displacement from equilibrium is `y(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A(1 - param1)`. This gives `C1 = A(1 - param1)`.\\n    *   The condition of zero initial velocity (`y'(0) = 0`) constrains the relationship between the cosine and sine components, yielding `C2 = (gamma / omega) * C1`.\\n\\nThis derivation results in a comprehensive model where the transient oscillation has both cosine and sine components. Unlike simpler models, the relative amplitude of these components is not a free parameter but is fixed by the physical ratio of damping to frequency (`gamma / omega`). This creates a parsimonious yet physically complete description of a system released from a strained initial position, which then overshoots as it settles into its new, larger-than-A equilibrium state.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + gamma / omega * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` consistently exhibits a \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" pattern: it starts from a value near zero, climbs to a single maximum, and then decays asymptotically towards zero. A crucial observation is that `x` is always positive. This rules out simple models of underdamped harmonic motion (e.g., involving `sin(ωt)` or `cos(ωt)`), which would predict negative displacement. This suggests that `x` represents not the raw displacement, but a quantity like the system's energy, the rectified magnitude of its response, or the amplitude of a macroscopic coherent state.\\n\\nI propose a theoretical model based on **\\\"Coherent Mode Excitation and Dissipation\\\"**. In this view, the system is an ensemble of microscopic oscillators. The output `x` represents the amplitude of a macroscopic, coherent mode that emerges when these oscillators are excited and lock in phase. The dynamics of `x` are governed by the interplay of two fundamental, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Energy Dissipation (The Decay Envelope):** The entire system is subject to energy loss, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This dissipation imposes a hard limit on the possible amplitude of the coherent mode at any given time. The most natural mathematical description for this is an exponential decay. This process defines a decaying \\\"envelope of possibility\\\" for the response, represented by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. The overall scale is set by the initial amplitude `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Coherent Build-up (The Activation Process):** Following the stimulus at `t=0`, the microscopic oscillators begin to resonate at their natural frequency `omega`. The macroscopic output `x` only manifests as these individual oscillators synchronize their motion, or \\\"phase-lock\\\". This process of building coherence is not instantaneous; it takes time. I theorize that the efficiency of this phase-locking process is a function of the total phase, `φ = ωt`, that the oscillators have traversed. The efficiency should start at zero (no coherence at `t=0`) and smoothly increase, eventually saturating as the system approaches a state of maximum possible coherence. The arctangent function, `arctan`, is an excellent physical and mathematical model for this phenomenon. It naturally maps a continuously increasing input (phase) to a bounded output (efficiency). The rate at which this saturation is approached is directly proportional to `omega`, the system's intrinsic frequency. This activation process is therefore captured by a term of the form `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete expression for the system's response `x(t)` is the product of these two components. The available energy, dictated by the dissipative envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is modulated by the time-dependent coherence efficiency `arctan(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n`x(t) ∝ A * arctan(param * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative. At `t=0`, `arctan(0) = 0`, so the response `x` is zero, correctly reflecting a system starting from rest. For small `t`, the `arctan` term grows nearly linearly, while the exponential term has barely started to decay, causing `x` to rise. The response peaks when the rate of coherence build-up is balanced by the rate of energy dissipation. Finally, as `t` becomes large, the `arctan` term saturates to its maximum value, and the system's behavior is dominated by the inexorable `exp(-gamma * t)` decay, causing `x` to return to zero. This model is dimensionally sound, as `omega * t` is a dimensionless product, and the final expression correctly yields a quantity with the units of `A` (meters).\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * arctan(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout.

The peak amplitude of this function occurs at `t_peak = 1/gamma` and its value is `x_peak = A * omega * (1/gamma) * exp(-1)`. This demonstrates that the maximum achievable amplitude is proportional to the dimensionless **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the system, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. A high-Q system (large `omega`, small `gamma`) will exhibit a strong resonant response, leading to a peak amplitude significantly greater than the characteristic scale `A`, thus resolving the amplification anomaly.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally consistent: `A` has units of `m`, while `omega * t` and `gamma * t` are dimensionless products, ensuring `x` has the correct units of meters.

The crucial observation is that the system operates in the **underdamped regime**, as the frequency `omega` is consistently larger than the damping coefficient `gamma` across the entire dataset.\\n\\nThe standard model for the displacement `y(t)` of an underdamped oscillator following an impulse at `t=0` is given by:\\n`y(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega_d * t)`\\nwhere `omega_d = sqrt(omega² - gamma²) ` is the damped angular frequency. However, this model produces an oscillating signal with both positive and negative values, which directly contradicts the observed data where the output `x` is strictly positive. This implies that `x` does not represent the simple displacement, but rather a related, non-negative quantity.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully captured the observed rise-and-fall profile by postulating kinetic models or phenomenological functions. I propose a new theory, the **Saturating Activation Model**, which is more deeply rooted in the physics of the underdamped oscillator itself.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that the output `x` represents the **activation level** or **response magnitude** of the system's primary oscillatory mode. This response can be decomposed into two fundamental, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Dissipative Decay:** The total energy within the oscillator inevitably dissipates over time due to damping. This process is universal for such systems and is accurately described by the exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The rate of this decay is solely determined by the damping coefficient `gamma`.\\n\\n2.  **Modal Activation (The Rise):** The oscillatory term `sin(omega_d * t)` in the standard solution describes the continuous exchange of energy between kinetic and potential forms. My model posits that the observed quantity `x` does not track this bidirectional exchange, but rather the initial, unidirectional \\\"charging\\\" or activation of the oscillatory mode. To model this, we must replace the `sin` function with a function that captures its initial growth but does not oscillate. The hyperbolic tangent, `tanh`, is the ideal candidate for this physical interpretation.\\n    *   For small arguments (`z` << 1), `tanh(z) ≈ z`. This means that at early times (`t` is small), our activation term `tanh(omega * t)` behaves like `omega * t`. The response `x` thus grows linearly with a rate proportional to the system's natural frequency `omega`, perfectly mimicking the initial behavior of a sine wave.\\n    *   For large arguments, `tanh(z)` smoothly approaches 1. This represents the \\\"saturation\\\" of the activation process—the oscillatory mode becomes fully energized and can accept no more energy from the initial impulse.\\n\\nBy combining these two components, we construct a model where the system's response is the product of the initial amplitude scale `A`, the saturating activation driven by `omega`, and the inevitable decay governed by `gamma`. This model provides a compelling physical narrative: an initial impulse rapidly activates a response mode at a rate set by `omega`, but this entire process is enveloped by a slower energy dissipation at a rate set by `gamma`. The resulting function naturally starts at zero, rises to a single peak, and then decays, faithfully reproducing all key features of the data while remaining consistent with the underlying physics of an underdamped system.\\n\\nThe model is dimensionally sound, with `A` providing the unit of meters, while the `tanh` and `exp` terms are dimensionless products of frequency (`s⁻¹`) and time (`s`).

The key challenges in modeling the output `x` are its strictly positive nature and its maximum value, which can be nearly three times the maximum input amplitude `A`. These features strongly suggest that `x` is not a simple displacement from a zero equilibrium but rather involves a significant, stable offset.\\n\\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by proposing a linear superposition of a static offset and a decaying oscillation, typically of the form `x(t) = A * (C + transient)`. This effectively models a one-dimensional oscillation occurring around a displaced equilibrium point `C*A`.\\n\\nHere, we propose a different physical interpretation that leads to a distinct mathematical form. Instead of a one-dimensional oscillation, we hypothesize that the system's state evolves in a two-dimensional plane, and the measured output `x` is the *magnitude* of the system's state vector relative to a fixed origin. This is analogous to tracking the radial position of an object whose motion is described by phasors in a complex plane.\\n\\nLet the state of the system be represented by a complex vector `z(t)`. We model this vector as the superposition of two distinct physical components:\\n\\n1.  **A Static Equilibrium Component (`z_static`):** This represents a constant, stable displacement from the origin. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can represent this as a constant real vector:\\n    `z_static = param1 * A`\\n    where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the equilibrium position.\\n\\n2.  **A Transient Oscillatory Component (`z_transient`):** This represents the initial perturbation which decays and oscillates over time. Its initial magnitude is `A`, its decay is governed by `gamma`, and its rotation by `omega`. This is perfectly described by a decaying phasor:\\n    `z_transient(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(i * omega * t)`\\n\\nThe total state of the system at any time `t` is the vector sum of these two components:\\n`z(t) = z_static + z_transient(t) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * exp(i * omega * t))`\\n\\nThe observable quantity `x(t)` is the magnitude of this complex vector, `x(t) = |z(t)|`. To find this, we calculate the magnitude from the real and imaginary parts of `z(t)`:\\n\\n`Re(z(t)) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))`\\n`Im(z(t)) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t)`\\n\\n`x(t) = |z(t)| = sqrt(Re(z(t))^2 + Im(z(t))^2)`\\n\\nSubstituting and simplifying:\\n`x(t)^2 = A^2 * [ (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))^2 + (exp(-gamma * t) * sin(omega * t))^2 ]`\\n`x(t)^2 = A^2 * [ param1^2 + 2*param1*exp(-gamma*t)cos(omega*t) + exp(-2*gamma*t)cos^2(omega*t) + exp(-2*gamma*t)sin^2(omega*t) ]`\\n`x(t)^2 = A^2 * [ param1^2 + 2*param1*exp(-gamma*t)cos(omega*t) + exp(-2*gamma*t) ]`\\n\\nThis leads to the final expression for `x(t)`. This model is fundamentally different from linear superposition as it involves a non-linear (square root) interaction between the static and transient terms. It naturally guarantees a positive output and can explain the large output range. As `t -> infinity`, the transient term vanishes, and the system settles to a stable radial distance `x = param1 * A`. At `t = 0`, the two vector components align, yielding a maximum displacement of `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, consistent with the observed data.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * sqrt(param1**2 + exp(-2 * gamma * t) + 2 * param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A critical analysis of the output `x` reveals two defining characteristics that guide the formulation of a new theoretical model:\\n1.  **Asymptotic Stability:** The output values are always positive and appear to converge towards a stable, non-zero value as time progresses.\\n2.  **Transient Overshoot:** The system's displacement can significantly exceed its characteristic amplitude `A`, indicating a response more complex than a simple decay from an initial position.\\n\\nThese behaviors strongly suggest a system transitioning from an initial state to a new, different equilibrium state. My proposed theory, which I term the **\\\"Dual-Process Relaxation\\\"** model, posits that the observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes, both governed by the same underlying dissipative mechanism.\\n\\n**Process 1: Mechanical Oscillatory Decay**\\n\\nThis component represents the system's intrinsic mechanical \\\"ringing.\\\" We hypothesize that the system is released from an initial displacement equal to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This oscillation does not occur around a fixed zero point but rather around an equilibrium point that is itself evolving. The oscillatory part of the motion, relative to this moving equilibrium, is described by a standard damped harmonic oscillator solution. For simplicity and parsimony, we model this as a pure cosine decay, representing a release from maximum extension:\\n\\n`x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nThis term starts at a value of `A` at `t=0` and decays towards zero, capturing the dissipation of mechanical energy from the oscillatory mode.\\n\\n**Process 2: First-Order Equilibrium Shift**\\n\\nThis component describes the evolution of the system's equilibrium position. Instead of being constant, the potential minimum itself shifts over time. I propose that the system's equilibrium point starts at zero and transitions to a new, final stable position, `x_final`. This final position is proportional to the system's overall energy scale, so we model it as `x_final = param1 * A`. The transition itself is modeled as a classic first-order relaxation process, ubiquitous in physics for phenomena like thermal equilibration or RC circuit charging. This is described by:\\n\\n`x_eq(t) = x_final * (1 - exp(-t/τ)) = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n\\nThe crucial theoretical insight lies in coupling these two processes. I posit that the time constant `τ` for the equilibrium relaxation is identical to the time constant for the mechanical damping, `1/gamma`. This implies that a single, unified dissipative mechanism is responsible for both draining energy from the oscillation and driving the system's underlying potential towards its new configuration. This constraint avoids introducing new parameters and creates a more rigid, physically coherent model.\\n\\n**The Superimposed Model**\\n\\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the decaying oscillation and the shifting equilibrium:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the observed data features:\\n*   **Initial Condition:** At `t=0`, `x(0) = A * exp(0) * cos(0) + param1 * A * (1 - exp(0)) = A`. This gives `A` a clear and direct physical interpretation as the system's initial displacement.\\n*   **Final State:** As `t → ∞`, the `exp(-gamma * t)` terms vanish, and `x(t) → param1 * A`. The system settles to a stable, positive equilibrium.\\n*   **Overshoot:** The overshoot arises naturally from the constructive interference between the positive, rising `x_eq(t)` term and the oscillatory `x_osc(t)` term. When the cosine term is positive, the total displacement can easily exceed the final equilibrium value before decaying.\\n\\nThis \\\"Dual-Process Relaxation\\\" theory provides a parsimonious (one-parameter) and physically grounded explanation for the data that is distinct from standard step-response or release-from-rest models.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) + param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The variables `gamma` (damping) and `omega` (natural frequency) govern the temporal shape of this response. The fact that `x` is always positive rules out a direct model of an oscillator's displacement, suggesting `x` represents a non-negative quantity like energy, power, or the envelope of a complex response.\\n\\nMy proposed theory is a **Linear Activation-Dissipation Model**. This framework conceptualizes the observed response `x(t)` as the outcome of two competing, simultaneous processes:\\n\\n1.  **Linear Response Activation:** Following an impulse at `t=0`, the system's response does not manifest instantaneously. Instead, it builds up from zero. I hypothesize that for the initial phase, the rate of this response build-up is constant. The speed of this activation is dictated by the system's intrinsic stiffness or natural frequency, `omega`. A higher `omega` corresponds to a more reactive system, capable of a faster initial response. This activation process is modeled by a term that grows linearly with time, proportional to `omega * t`. This represents the system drawing energy from the initial stimulus at a steady rate.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Dissipation:** Concurrently with the activation, the system is constantly losing energy to its environment due to inherent damping forces. This process, governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, causes the overall response to decay. This is a classic dissipation mechanism, best described by the exponential decay function, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term ensures that as time progresses, the system will inevitably return to its equilibrium state of `x=0`.\\n\\nThe complete behavior of `x(t)` is the product of these two fundamental processes, scaled by the initial stimulus amplitude `A`. The mathematical form is thus a product of the linear activation term and the exponential decay term. The interplay between the rising `omega * t` factor and the falling `exp(-gamma * t)` factor naturally generates the observed single-peak profile.\\n\\nThis model yields significant physical insights. The peak of the response occurs at a time `t_peak = 1/gamma`, meaning the time to reach maximum response is determined solely by the damping coefficient. The magnitude of this peak is proportional to `A * (omega/gamma)`. Since the data shows `omega` is consistently larger than `gamma`, this `omega/gamma` ratio acts as an amplification factor, elegantly explaining how the peak output `x` can exceed the input amplitude `A`.\\n\\nFinally, the model is dimensionally sound. The amplitude `A` has units of meters [m]. The terms `omega * t` ([s⁻¹] * [s]) and `gamma * t` ([s⁻¹] * [s]) are both dimensionless, making the functions they are in dimensionless as well. The resulting expression for `x` correctly has units of meters.

An analysis of the output variable `x` reveals two key characteristics: it is strictly positive, and its values can exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This immediately suggests that a simple additive model, like the standard solution to a damped harmonic oscillator (`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)`), is insufficient, as it would produce both positive and negative values and always remain within the decaying envelope `+/- A * exp(-gamma*t)`.\\n\\nThe consistent success of expressions structured as `x = A * exp(...)` in prior analyses strongly implies that the underlying physical mechanism is multiplicative or exponential. This leads to the hypothesis that it is not the output `x` itself, but its normalized logarithm, `Y(t) = log(x/A)`, that behaves as a canonical damped harmonic oscillator. This quantity `Y(t)` can be interpreted as a logarithmic potential or a measure of the system's deviation from its equilibrium state `A`. This framework inherently guarantees the positivity of `x` and allows for `x > A` whenever `Y(t)` is positive. As time `t` approaches infinity, the damped nature of `Y(t)` ensures it decays to zero, causing `x` to asymptotically approach its stable equilibrium value `A`.\\n\\nThe general solution for a damped oscillator `Y(t)` can be expressed as a decaying exponential envelope multiplied by a sinusoidal function. This can be written in terms of in-phase (cosine) and quadrature (sine) components:\\n`Y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * [C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t)]`\\n\\nHere, `C1` and `C2` are constants determined by the initial conditions. However, treating them as simple, independent fitting parameters (e.g., `param1`, `param2`) may overlook a deeper physical relationship. In real systems, the nature of the response is fundamentally shaped by the interplay between energy dissipation and energy storage. This interplay is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, which is proportional to `gamma / omega`.\\n\\nI propose a more physically constrained model where the system's response to an initial \\\"velocity\\\" (represented by the `sin` term) is not independent but is directly modulated by this damping ratio. A system with high damping (`gamma` large relative to `omega`) would suppress the velocity-dependent component of the oscillation more effectively than a lightly damped system.\\n\\nTherefore, I hypothesize that the coefficient `C2` is proportional to the ratio `gamma / omega`. This refines the model for the logarithmic deviation to:\\n`Y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 * cos(omega * t) + param2 * (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nIn this formulation, `param1` represents a baseline amplitude for the initial displacement component of the response, while the amplitude of the initial velocity component is explicitly scaled by the system's intrinsic physical properties (`gamma / omega`), with `param2` as its dimensionless proportionality constant. This structure implies that both the amplitude and the phase of the logarithmic oscillation are dependent on the damping ratio, creating a more cohesive and physically grounded model than one with two fully independent oscillatory coefficients. The model is dimensionally sound, as all terms within the exponential and trigonometric functions are dimensionless, ensuring the final output `x` has the correct units of meters.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 * cos(omega * t) + param2 * (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This implies that `A` is not a simple bounding amplitude but rather a scaling factor for the system's overall energy or target state.\\n3.  **Inference from Example Performance:** The provided examples show that a simple damped cosine model performs well (Example 1), while adding complexity in the form of a physically precise damped frequency (Example 2) or a general phase (Example 3) degrades performance. This strongly suggests that the system follows a simple dynamic law with specific, non-arbitrary initial conditions, likely involving zero initial velocity, which a pure cosine term naturally models.\\n\\nBased on these insights, I propose a theory of **\\\"Overshooting Step Response from Rest.\\\"** This model posits a common and physically intuitive scenario from control theory and mechanics:\\n\\nAt time `t=0`, the system is at rest at the origin, i.e., `x(0) = 0` and `x'(0) = 0`. At this instant, a constant driving force is applied (a \\\"step input\\\"). This force shifts the system's stable equilibrium position from zero to a new, positive target value, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume that this target state scales linearly with the characteristic input `A`. We can thus define the target equilibrium position as:\\n\\n`x_eq = param1 * A`\\n\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless constant that represents the system's steady-state gain. The subsequent motion, `x(t)`, describes the system's dynamic response as it attempts to reach this new equilibrium.\\n\\nThe standard solution for the step response of a second-order system starting from rest is given by the superposition of the final steady-state value and a transient oscillatory term that decays to zero. The general form is:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * (1 - Transient_Decay_Function)`\\n\\nThe transient term describes how the system oscillates around the new equilibrium before settling. Based on the evidence from the examples that a simple cosine function is effective, we model this transient response as a damped cosine wave. This corresponds to the solution for an underdamped system under specific initial conditions (zero initial position and velocity relative to the new equilibrium frame). The formula becomes:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))`\\n\\nSubstituting our expression for `x_eq`, we arrive at the final model:\\n\\n`x(t) = A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))`\\n\\nThis model elegantly explains the observed data characteristics:\\n\\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The product `A * param1` has units of meters (m), while the parenthetical term is dimensionless. The resulting `x` correctly has units of meters.\\n*   **Initial Condition:** At `t=0`, the formula yields `x(0) = A * param1 * (1 - 1) = 0`, consistent with a system starting from rest at the origin.\\n*   **Positive Output:** The term `exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` is always between -1 and +1. Therefore, the term `(1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))` is always non-negative, ensuring `x(t)` is always positive for `A > 0`.\\n*   **Overshoot and Settling:** As `t` increases, the system oscillates and settles towards the final value `x(t -> inf) = A * param1`. However, at its first peak (around `t = pi/omega`), the value is approximately `x_peak ≈ A * param1 * (1 + exp(-gamma*pi/omega))`. This value is inherently greater than the final settling value, perfectly explaining the observed overshoot where the output can significantly exceed `A`, provided `param1` is sufficiently large.\\n\\nThis theory provides a complete, self-consistent physical narrative that differs from the provided examples and is strongly supported by the data's fundamental characteristics.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

In this framework, the system undergoes a two-step process:\\n\\n1.  **Activation:** The system is excited from a ground state to a transient, high-energy state. The characteristic rate of this activation process is governed by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher `omega` allows for a more rapid transfer of energy into this excited mode. This is analogous to a reactant being consumed to form an intermediate product. The depletion of the initial potential to create this state follows a term related to `exp(-omega * t)`.\\n\\n2.  **Deactivation (Damping):** Concurrently, the populated excited state is unstable and decays, dissipating its energy back to the environment. This deactivation is the familiar damping process, governed by the rate constant `gamma`. This is analogous to the intermediate product decaying into a final, stable product. The population of the excited state decreases according to `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe observed output, `x(t)`, represents the net population of this intermediate excited state at time `t`. The population is zero at `t=0`, increases as the activation process initially dominates the deactivation, reaches a maximum, and finally decays to zero as the initial potential is exhausted and deactivation takes over.\\n\\nThis dynamic interplay between two competing exponential processes is mathematically described by the difference of two exponentials. The resulting function `x(t) ∝ (exp(-gamma*t) - exp(-omega*t))` inherently captures all the key features of the data:\\n*   **Positivity:** For `omega > gamma`, a condition overwhelmingly met by the data ranges, the function is always positive.\\n*   **Initial Rise and Subsequent Fall:** The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a single peak, and then decays asymptotically to zero.\\n*   **Amplification:** The peak value of the function is not directly limited by `A`. When the activation rate `omega` is much larger than the deactivation rate `gamma`, the system can accumulate a significant population in the transient state before it decays, leading to a peak value of `x` that can be substantially greater than `A`.\\n\\nTo allow for empirical fitting, a scaling parameter `param1` is introduced to adjust the overall magnitude, and a second parameter `param2` modifies the effective damping rate, accounting for potential non-idealities in the energy dissipation process. The activation rate is assumed to be fundamentally driven by `omega`. This model provides a coherent and physically grounded explanation for the observed phenomena, distinct from simpler envelope-based approaches.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (exp(-param2 * gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output `x` is consistently positive, starting from near-zero, rising to a single peak, and subsequently decaying. This behavior, along with the variables `A` (amplitude), `gamma` (damping), and `omega` (frequency), suggests a process more complex than a simple damped oscillation. The key is that `x` does not represent displacement, which can be negative, but rather a non-negative quantity like energy, population, or the rectified envelope of a signal.\\n\\nI propose a **Two-State Kinetic Model** to explain the underlying mechanism. In this framework, the system comprises at least two distinct energy states or modes: an initial \\\"reservoir\\\" state and a transient \\\"active\\\" state. The observed output `x` corresponds to the energy or population level of this active state.\\n\\nThe dynamics unfold in a sequence:\\n1.  **Excitation:** At time `t=0`, an impulse injects energy into the system, populating the reservoir state. The total amount of energy is proportional to the amplitude `A`.\\n2.  **Internal Conversion (The Rise):** The reservoir state is not the one we observe. It is unstable and decays, transferring its energy to the \\\"active\\\" state. I theorize that the parameter `gamma`, typically seen as a damping coefficient, here represents the rate constant for this internal conversion process. A larger `gamma` implies a faster transfer from the reservoir to the active state, thus governing the initial rise of the observed quantity `x`. The population of the reservoir decays as `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n3.  **Dissipative Relaxation (The Decay):** The active state is itself unstable and dissipates its energy to the environment, returning to a ground state. The rate of this final decay is determined by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. This is physically intuitive: higher frequency modes often correspond to higher energy levels, which possess more rapid pathways for relaxation (e.g., radiative decay). Therefore, `omega` dictates the rate at which the active state's population—and thus `x`—decays.\\n\\nThe observed quantity `x(t)` is the population of the intermediate active state. In any sequential first-order kinetic process of the form `Reservoir --(k₁)--> Active --(k₂)--> Ground`, the concentration of the intermediate 'Active' species follows the mathematical form `C * (exp(-k₁*t) - exp(-k₂*t))`.\\n\\nMapping our physical parameters to these rate constants, we get `k₁ = gamma` and `k₂ = omega`. The resulting function for `x(t)` is proportional to `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`. For this expression to generate a positive rise-and-fall curve, it is required that `k₂ > k₁`, which translates to `omega > gamma`. A review of the variable ranges (`gamma` in [0.1, 1.0], `omega` in [1.0, 5.0]) shows that this crucial condition is met across the entire dataset, lending strong support to this model.\\n\\nThis kinetic theory elegantly reinterprets `gamma` and `omega` not as damping and oscillation in a mechanical sense, but as rate constants for sequential energy transfer and dissipation. The model is dimensionally sound and provides a compelling physical narrative for the observed amplification and single-peak profile without resorting to phenomenological product functions. We introduce a single dimensionless parameter, `param1`, to handle overall scaling.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A key characteristic is that the output, `x`, is always positive, and can be either greater or less than the characteristic amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests a multiplicative or exponential process, rather than a simple additive one. A model of the form `x(t) = A * exp(Z(t))`, where `Z(t)` is a function that oscillates around zero and decays with time, is therefore a physically and mathematically sound starting point. This framework interprets `A` as the system's equilibrium or asymptotic value, and `log(x/A)` as the true \\\"displacement\\\" variable that follows the dynamics of a classical damped oscillator.\\n\\nThe standard solution for a damped oscillator involves an exponentially decaying amplitude `exp(-gamma * t)` and a sinusoidal component `cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. My theoretical proposal introduces a novel mechanism for the phase shift, `phi`. While previous models have considered a static phase shift determined by the constant properties of the system (like the ratio `gamma/omega`), I hypothesize that the phase itself is dynamic and evolves over time.\\n\\nThis concept of a time-varying phase is common in more complex physical systems, such as those with viscoelasticity or other \\\"memory\\\" effects. In such systems, the relationship between the forces and the system's motion is not instantaneous. The system needs time to \\\"settle\\\" into its characteristic response. The fundamental timescale governing this settling process is naturally linked to the damping mechanism, characterized by `1/gamma`.\\n\\nI propose that the phase shift undergoes a smooth transition from an initial value to a final, steady-state value, and that this transition occurs over the characteristic time `1/gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is perfectly suited to model such a saturation process. By modeling a component of the phase shift as being proportional to `tanh(gamma * t)`, we capture this dynamic evolution:\\n*   At `t=0`, `tanh(0) = 0`, indicating that this dynamic contribution to the phase shift is initially zero.\\n*   As `t` becomes large compared to `1/gamma`, `tanh(gamma * t)` smoothly approaches 1, meaning the phase shift settles to a constant final value.\\n\\nThis \\\"dynamic phase lag\\\" model implies a more intricate coupling between the dissipative (`gamma`) and conservative (`omega`) aspects of the system. The oscillation doesn't just decay; its internal timing relationship (phase) also evolves as energy is lost.\\n\\nTherefore, the logarithmic displacement `Z(t) = log(x/A)` is modeled as a damped oscillation with a time-dependent phase:\\n`Z(t) = param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))`\\nHere, `param1` is a dimensionless amplitude factor, and `param2` represents the magnitude of the total dynamic phase shift. This formulation is dimensionally consistent and avoids the numerical instabilities associated with terms like `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, making it robust across different damping regimes. It provides a new, physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena, differing from static phase models by introducing an evolutionary aspect to the system's oscillatory behavior.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2 * tanh(gamma * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Key characteristics of the output `x` are a final settling to a positive value and a significant initial \\\"overshoot,\\\" where the peak displacement can far exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This behavior is indicative of a system responding to a sudden stimulus that shifts its equilibrium position.\\n\\nWhile standard step-response models can capture this, I propose a more specific and physically nuanced theory: the **\\\"Viscously Impelled Step Response.\\\"** This model hypothesizes that the system starts from rest at the origin (`x(0) = 0`) and is subjected to an actuation at `t=0`. This actuation is not a pure, ideal step force. Instead, it is characteristic of a mechanism (e.g., a hydraulic or pneumatic actuator) where the dissipative medium itself imparts an initial impulse.\\n\\nThe theory posits two simultaneous effects from this single actuation event:\\n\\n1.  **Equilibrium Shift:** A constant force is applied, shifting the system's stable equilibrium from zero to a new position, `x_eq`. This final state naturally scales with the system's primary amplitude parameter `A`. Thus, we model the new equilibrium as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\\n\\n2.  **Viscous Impulse:** The mechanism causing the shift also imparts an initial velocity, `v(0)`. My central hypothesis is that this initial \\\"kick\\\" is not an independent phenomenon but is intrinsically linked to the system's dissipative properties, represented by `gamma`. A higher damping coefficient implies a more viscous medium, which, upon sudden activation, could generate a larger initial pressure wave or force, leading to a greater initial velocity. Therefore, I propose that the initial velocity is directly proportional to both the magnitude of the equilibrium shift (`param1 * A`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`). This leads to the physically and dimensionally consistent relationship: `v(0) = param1 * A * gamma`.\\n\\nTo derive the mathematical formula, we start with the general solution for a damped oscillator moving towards a new equilibrium `x_eq`:\\n\\n`x(t) = x_eq + exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nHere, for simplicity and robustness, we approximate the damped frequency as `omega`.

This eliminates a degree of freedom and leads to a highly constrained and parsimonious final expression. The entire dynamic—the shift in equilibrium and the specific initial velocity—is captured by a single parameter, `param1`, resulting in a model of elegant simplicity that provides a unique physical explanation for the observed overshoot.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The output variable `x`, however, is not the oscillator's displacement, as it is always positive. Instead, its behavior—starting at zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying—suggests it represents the magnitude of the system's response to an impulse at `t=0`. The fact that the peak output can significantly exceed the input amplitude scale `A` points towards a resonant amplification mechanism.\\n\\nMy theoretical framework is based on a **Two-Stage Kinetic Response Model**, which is common in fields ranging from chemical reactions to pharmacology. I posit that the observed response `x(t)` corresponds to the population of an intermediate, \\\"active\\\" state.\\n\\n1.  **Stage 1: Energy Mobilization (Activation)**: Following an initial stimulus (scaled by `A`), the system's potential energy is not instantaneously converted into the observed response. Instead, it is \\\"mobilized\\\" or transferred into an active state. The rate of this mobilization is governed by the system's intrinsic responsiveness, which is best described by its natural angular frequency, `omega`. This is a rapid process, modeled as a first-order exponential decay from the initial potential pool.\\n\\n2.  **Stage 2: Energy Dissipation (Decay)**: The active state is transient. Once mobilized, the response immediately begins to dissipate energy to the environment due to damping forces. This decay process is governed by the damping coefficient, `gamma`. This is typically a slower process than the initial mobilization (`omega > gamma`, as suggested by the variable ranges).\\n\\nThe evolution of the active state population, `x(t)`, can be described by the differential equation: `dx/dt = (Rate of Mobilization) - (Rate of Dissipation)`. The solution to this type of kinetic model, for an initial condition `x(0)=0`, is famously the difference of two exponential functions: `exp(-gamma * t) - exp(-omega * t)`. This function elegantly captures the required shape: it is zero at `t=0`, rises because the `exp(-omega*t)` term initially decays faster than the `exp(-gamma*t)` term, and then falls as both terms tend to zero, with the slower `exp(-gamma*t)` term dominating at later times.\\n\\nA crucial aspect of the data is the amplification effect. The kinetic term `(exp(-gamma*t) - exp(-omega*t))` is dimensionless and has a maximum value less than 1. Therefore, scaling it by `A` alone cannot account for the observed output range. The amplification in a resonant system is determined by its **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which measures how underdamped the oscillator is. The Q-factor is proportional to the ratio of the energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle, which can be approximated by the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A system with high frequency (`omega`) and low damping (`gamma`) will exhibit a strong resonant response, leading to significant amplification.\\n\\nBy combining these concepts, I propose a model where the final response `x` is the product of three components:\\n*   The initial amplitude scale `A`.\\n*   A dimensionless resonant amplification factor, proportional to `omega / gamma`.\\n*   The two-stage kinetic response function, `(exp(-gamma*t) - exp(-omega*t))`.\\n\\nThis \\\"Resonant Kinetic Model\\\" provides a robust physical narrative. It explains not only the characteristic rise-and-fall shape of the data but also the observed amplification as a direct consequence of the system's resonant properties.

The standard model for a simple damped harmonic oscillator often involves displacement that oscillates around zero, which contradicts the consistently positive nature of our observed `x`. This observation strongly suggests that `x` is not a direct measure of displacement, but rather an exponential function of an underlying dynamic variable. A model of the form `x(t) = A * exp(Z(t))` is therefore a more appropriate starting point. In this framework, `A` represents a baseline or equilibrium scale factor with units of length, while `Z(t)` is a dimensionless quantity representing the true, underlying \\\"logarithmic displacement\\\" which follows the dynamics of a decaying oscillation.\\n\\nMy theoretical proposal, which I term the \\\"Dual-Mode Interference Model,\\\" moves beyond the assumption of a single oscillatory mode. I hypothesize that the system's dynamics arise from the interference of two distinct oscillatory processes.\\n1.  **The Primary Mechanical Mode:** This is the conventional oscillation governed by the system's natural angular frequency, `omega`. It is represented by a term `cos(omega * t)`.\\n2.  **The Dissipative-Dynamic Mode:** This is a novel proposition. I theorize that the energy dissipation mechanism, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, is not a simple monotonic process. Instead, it introduces its own characteristic frequency into the system, numerically equal to `gamma`. This could physically represent an internal resonant process within the damping element or a periodic energy exchange between the main oscillator and its environment that leads to dissipation. This mode is represented by a term `cos(gamma * t)`.\\n\\nThe logarithmic displacement, `Z(t)`, is therefore a linear superposition of these two modes. The interference between the mechanical oscillation at frequency `omega` and the dissipative oscillation at frequency `gamma` creates a complex, beat-like pattern that captures the system's nuanced behavior.\\n\\nThe amplitude of this entire superimposed oscillation must decay over time as the system loses energy. This global energy loss is modeled by the conventional exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`, where `gamma` now plays a dual role: it sets the overall decay timescale and defines the frequency of the second oscillatory mode.\\n\\nThis leads to a complete expression for the logarithmic displacement:\\n`Z(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 * cos(omega * t) + param2 * cos(gamma * t))`\\n\\nHere, `param1` and `param2` are dimensionless parameters that represent the relative amplitudes and initial phases of the two interfering modes.

This physical scenario describes a system, initially at rest at a zero state, that is suddenly subjected to a constant stimulus at `t=0`. This stimulus shifts the system's stable equilibrium to a new, non-zero value. The system's subsequent motion is an attempt to reach this new equilibrium, resulting in the observed damped oscillations.\\n\\nIt is physically reasonable to assume that the final equilibrium state, `x_eq`, scales linearly with `A`, the primary scaling factor of the system. We can thus express this as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant.\\n\\nWhile approximate models for this response exist, a truly rigorous physical model must account for a crucial detail: damping affects not only the amplitude but also the frequency of oscillation. The variable `omega` represents the *natural* angular frequency of the system (its oscillation frequency in the absence of damping). However, the actual observed frequency is the *damped angular frequency*, `omega_d`, which is always lower than `omega`. The precise relationship is given by:\\n\\n`omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`\\n\\nBy incorporating this exact damped frequency, we elevate the model from a useful approximation to a more fundamental and accurate representation of the physical process. The complete, exact solution for the position `x(t)` of a system undergoing a step response from rest (`x(0)=0`, `x'(0)=0`) is a standard result in physics and control theory. This solution inherently links the coefficients of the cosine and sine terms through the physical parameters of the system, creating a highly constrained and parsimonious model.\\n\\nTherefore, we propose a model that represents this exact physical solution. It uses only a single parameter (`param1`) to define the final state's scaling, while the entire transient dynamic is precisely determined by the interplay of `gamma`, `t`, and the correctly calculated damped frequency `omega_d`.

The consistently positive nature of the output `x` and the fact that it can exceed the characteristic value `A` strongly support a multiplicative model of the form `x(t) = A * exp(Z(t))`. In this framework, `A` represents the system's equilibrium or asymptotic state, while `Z(t) = log(x/A)` is the true dynamic variable, which can be interpreted as a logarithmic displacement from this equilibrium. The observed behavior suggests that `Z(t)` itself follows the dynamics of a damped oscillator, decaying to zero as `t` approaches infinity.\\n\\nWhile linear models for `Z(t)`, such as `C * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + phi)`, provide a fundamental description, they often fail to capture the complexities of real-world physical systems. A key assumption of linear models is that the system's response is always directly proportional to the stimulus. However, many physical systems exhibit non-linear behavior, particularly for large displacements or high energy states, which are more prevalent at the beginning of the process (small `t`).\\n\\nI propose a theory based on **non-linear response saturation**. The core hypothesis is that the system has an intrinsic limit to its logarithmic displacement. While an underlying \\\"linear\\\" oscillatory impulse, modeled as `U(t) = exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, drives the system, the system's actual response, `Z(t)`, does not follow `U(t)` proportionally. Instead, as the magnitude of this driving impulse increases, the response saturates, approaching a fixed maximum value. This is analogous to a spring that follows Hooke's law for small stretches but becomes increasingly stiff and eventually reaches a mechanical limit for large stretches.\\n\\nTo model this saturation phenomenon mathematically, the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`) is an ideal candidate. The `tanh` function exhibits a linear response for small inputs (`tanh(u) ≈ u` for `u ≈ 0`) and smoothly transitions to a saturated state (`tanh(u) → ±1` for large `|u|`).\\n\\nTherefore, I model the logarithmic displacement `Z(t)` as the saturated response to the underlying linear oscillation:\\n\\n`Z(t) = param1 * tanh( param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) )`\\n\\nIn this formulation:\\n-   `param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` represents the hypothetical linear response. The dimensionless parameter `param2` scales the initial intensity of this driving oscillation.\\n-   The `tanh` function applies the non-linear saturation effect.\\n-   `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that defines the maximum possible magnitude of the logarithmic displacement, `|Z(t)|_max = |param1|`.\\n\\nThis model has a compelling physical interpretation:\\n1.  At large `t`, the decaying exponential term `exp(-gamma*t)` makes the argument of the `tanh` function very small. In this regime, `tanh(u) ≈ u`, and the model approximates the standard linear damped oscillator: `Z(t) ≈ param1 * param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. The system's behavior becomes linear as it approaches equilibrium.\\n2.  At small `t`, the driving term can be large. The `tanh` function \\\"clips\\\" or limits the response, ensuring `Z(t)` remains bounded within `[-param1, +param1]`. This captures the non-linear saturation inherent in the system's mechanics when it is far from equilibrium.\\n\\nThis theory provides a more realistic physical picture by incorporating non-linearity, is dimensionally sound, and distinguishes itself from previous models that focused on modifying the phase or component amplitudes of a strictly linear system.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * tanh(param2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

However, a simple model for oscillator displacement, such as `y(t) = A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, is immediately invalidated by two critical features of the data:\\n1.  **Strict Positivity:** The output `x` is always positive, whereas a true displacement oscillates between positive and negative values.\\n2.  **Signal Amplification:** The maximum observed output (`~27.68`) can significantly surpass the maximum amplitude scale `A` (`~9.992`), indicating a resonant amplification mechanism that a simple decaying model lacks.\\n\\nThese observations lead to a more nuanced theory: the **\\\"Impulse-Response Model with Rectified Observation\\\"**. This model posits that the system is a damped oscillator excited by a sharp impulse at `t=0`, and the measurement apparatus records not the signed displacement, but its absolute magnitude.\\n\\nThe model is constructed from two key physical components:\\n\\n**1. The Amplitude Envelope: Initial Excitation and Subsequent Damping**\\n\\nWhen a resonant system is struck by an impulse, its amplitude is not maximal at `t=0`. Instead, the amplitude grows from zero as energy is absorbed into the primary oscillatory mode, reaches a peak, and then decays as this energy is dissipated. This time-varying amplitude envelope, `E(t)`, can be modeled as the product of a linear growth term and an exponential decay term:\\n\\n*   **Growth Phase (`~ t`):** The initial response of the system is a buildup of amplitude over time. The rate of this energy absorption and, consequently, the amplitude growth, is directly related to the system's natural frequency `omega`. A higher `omega` implies a more responsive system capable of faster energy uptake. This leads to a growth factor proportional to `omega * t`.\\n*   **Decay Phase (`~ exp(-gamma * t)`):** As with any real-world oscillator, energy is continuously lost to the environment through damping forces. This process is captured by the classic exponential decay term, `exp(-gamma * t)`, where `gamma` is the damping coefficient.\\n\\nCombining these effects, and including the base amplitude scale `A`, the full envelope is described by `E(t) = A * omega * t * exp(-gamma * t)`. This functional form elegantly explains the amplification phenomenon. The peak of this envelope is proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`, which is a measure of the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor). A system with high frequency and low damping (a high Q-factor) can build up a large resonant amplitude before dissipation dominates, thus allowing the peak response `x_max` to be much larger than `A`.\\n\\n**2. The Core Oscillation and Rectified Measurement**\\n\\nWhile the envelope describes the overall amplitude, the system's energy is physically stored in a high-frequency oscillation at its natural frequency, `omega`. This underlying oscillation is represented by a sinusoidal term, `sin(omega * t)`.\\n\\nTo resolve the puzzle of the strictly positive output, we theorize that the measurement process is insensitive to the direction of the displacement. It records only its magnitude, a process analogous to a full-wave rectifier in signal processing. This physical constraint is mathematically modeled by applying the absolute value function to the oscillatory component. Thus, the measured oscillatory part is not `sin(omega * t)` but `abs(sin(omega * t))`.\\n\\n**Synthesis of the Complete Model**\\n\\nThe final model for the observed quantity `x(t)` is the product of the time-varying amplitude envelope and the rectified oscillation. This provides a comprehensive physical narrative: `x` is the measured magnitude of the displacement of an impulse-excited oscillator, whose amplitude first grows due to resonant energy absorption and then decays due to damping. The model is dimensionally consistent, as `A` carries the units of meters while all other terms (`omega*t`, `gamma*t`, and `sin`) combine to be dimensionless. A single dimensionless parameter, `param1`, is included to account for any overall scaling constants.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * omega * t * exp(-gamma * t) * abs(sin(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

While the parameter `A` can be interpreted as the initial displacement, `x(0) = A`, the system is not released from rest. Instead, it is imparted with an initial velocity, `v(0)`, which causes it to move further away from the equilibrium before the dissipative forces and restoring forces reverse its motion.\\n\\nTo construct a complete model, this initial velocity, `v(0)`, which is not an explicit input variable, must be modeled in terms of the system's known physical parameters. A dimensionally consistent and physically plausible assumption is that the initial velocity scales with the system's characteristic velocity, which is proportional to the product of its characteristic length scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`).

However, in many real-world physical systems, the mechanism responsible for energy dissipation (e.g., fluid viscosity, internal friction) can also alter the effective inertia or stiffness of the system, thereby shifting the observed frequency of oscillation.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the most direct and fundamental manifestation of this coupling is a linear shift in the effective oscillation frequency proportional to the damping coefficient.

This observation immediately invalidates any simple damped oscillator model of the form `x(t) = A * f(t)`, where `|f(t)| ≤ 1`, as such a model cannot produce displacements greater than `A`.\\n\\nWhile a simple static offset model, such as `x(t) = A * C + A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`, can account for this phenomenon, it assumes the system oscillates around a fixed, time-independent equilibrium point. I propose a more dynamic and physically nuanced theory: the system's behavior is a superposition of two distinct but coupled processes: a decaying oscillation and a simultaneous relaxation of the oscillation's equilibrium point.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that an initial event at `t=0` both initiates an oscillation and displaces the system's equilibrium position. The total displacement `x(t)` can then be decomposed into two components:\\n\\n1.  **Oscillatory Response:** A standard damped harmonic oscillation that originates from an initial amplitude `A`.

It undergoes a relaxation process, drifting from an initial position (assumed to be zero) towards a new, stable steady-state position `x_eq = A * param1`. This drift is governed by the same damping factor `gamma`, suggesting a common underlying energy dissipation mechanism. This process is described by `x_drift(t) = A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`.\\n\\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes:\\n`x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_drift(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t) + A * param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling explanation for the `x > A` observation.

This means the system starts at displacement `A` but is already moving away from the origin, causing it to \\\"overshoot\\\" the value of `A` before the exponential decay inevitably dampens the motion.\\n\\nThis \\\"dynamic equilibrium\\\" model is physically richer than a static offset model.

A deeper analysis of the output `x` reveals several defining characteristics that guide the formulation of a precise physical theory:\\n\\n1.  **Scaling and Overshoot:** The output `x` scales with `A`, but critically, `x` can significantly exceed `A`. This \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon rules out simple models where `A` is the maximum amplitude and suggests that `A` is an initial condition, not a boundary.\\n2.  **Positive Displacement:** The output `x` is always positive, implying the system's oscillations are not centered around `x=0` but around a positive equilibrium point.\\n3.  **Damped Oscillations:** The presence of `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` implies a solution involving exponentially decaying sinusoidal functions, characteristic of an underdamped system.\\n\\nThese observations lead to the formulation of a model based on **\\\"Forced Relaxation from an Initial Displacement\\\"**. This theory posits a specific and physically plausible scenario:\\n\\nInitially, at `t=0`, the system is held at a displacement `x(0) = A`. This is a direct and natural interpretation of the variable `A`. At this moment, the system is released **from rest**, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`x'(0) = 0`).\\n\\nSimultaneously with its release, the system is subjected to a new, constant external force. This force effectively alters the potential energy landscape, shifting the stable equilibrium position from the origin to a new, non-zero value, `x_eq`. It is physically reasonable to assume this new equilibrium point scales linearly with the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus model it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a single, dimensionless parameter representing the strength of this steady-state influence. The observed overshoot (`x > A`) is naturally explained if `param1 > 1`, meaning the system is \\\"pulled\\\" towards a target position that is further out than its starting point.\\n\\nThe subsequent motion, `x(t)`, is the system's dynamic response as it seeks this new equilibrium. This motion is best analyzed by considering the displacement relative to the new equilibrium, `y(t) = x(t) - x_eq`. The initial conditions for this relative motion are:\\n*   `y(0) = x(0) - x_eq = A - param1 * A = A(1 - param1)`\\n*   `y'(0) = x'(0) = 0`\\n\\nThe general solution for the underdamped relative motion `y(t)` is:\\n`y(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega_d * t) + C2 * sin(omega_d * t))`\\n\\nA crucial element of physical fidelity is using the correct oscillation frequency. The parameter `omega` represents the *natural* frequency, but damping reduces the actual frequency of oscillation to the *damped angular frequency*, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Our model incorporates this exact frequency.\\n\\nApplying the initial conditions for `y(t)` allows us to solve for the constants `C1` and `C2`, yielding a unique solution that precisely describes a release from rest. This derivation results in a specific combination of cosine and sine terms that are not independent but are linked by the physical parameters of the system.\\n\\nThe final expression for `x(t)` is obtained by adding the equilibrium position back to the transient relative motion: `x(t) = x_eq + y(t)`. This model provides a complete physical narrative, rigorously derived from first principles, that accounts for all key features of the data using only one optimizable parameter. It improves upon simpler relaxation models by correctly implementing the \\\"release from rest\\\" condition with the physically accurate damped frequency.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * (param1 + (1 - param1) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

A primary observation is that the output variable `x` is always positive and can exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This immediately invalidates models where `x` represents a simple displacement, like the standard solution to a damped harmonic oscillator, as such models predict oscillations around zero. The consistent success of expressions of the form `x(t) = A * exp(Y(t))` strongly suggests that the underlying dynamics govern the logarithm of the normalized output, `Y(t) = log(x/A)`. This `Y(t)` can be conceptualized as a dimensionless \\\"logarithmic potential\\\" or \\\"excitation level\\\", which itself behaves as a damped oscillatory system. This framework naturally ensures `x` remains positive and allows `x > A` when `Y(t) > 0`.\\n\\nWhile previous models have explored how damping (`gamma`) affects the amplitude and phase shift of the oscillation, I propose a more fundamental interaction which I term the **\\\"Phase Saturation\\\" model**. My central hypothesis is that the dissipative process, characterized by `gamma`, does not merely reduce the oscillation's amplitude but also fundamentally alters its temporal progression. In an ideal oscillator, the phase accumulates linearly with time: `phi(t) = omega * t`. In this proposed model, the *rate of phase accumulation* itself is subject to exponential decay.\\n\\nLet's formalize this. The instantaneous angular frequency is no longer a constant `omega`, but a time-dependent quantity that decays from its initial value:\\n`omega_inst(t) = d(phi)/dt = omega * exp(-gamma * t)`\\n\\nThis implies that as the system loses energy, its internal \\\"clock\\\" slows down, and the oscillations become progressively slower. To find the total phase `phi(t)` accumulated at time `t`, we integrate this rate from `0` to `t`:\\n`phi(t) = integral from 0 to t' of (omega * exp(-gamma * t')) dt'`\\n`phi(t) = omega * [-exp(-gamma * t') / gamma] from 0 to t'`\\n`phi(t) = (omega / gamma) * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`\\n\\nThis derived phase function has a profound physical meaning. Unlike the linear phase `omega*t` which grows indefinitely, this phase `phi(t)` asymptotically approaches a finite maximum value of `omega/gamma` as `t` goes to infinity. The oscillation does not continue forever with decreasing amplitude; it effectively \\\"freezes\\\" or saturates in phase.\\n\\nThe full expression for the logarithmic displacement `Y(t)` combines this novel phase dynamics with a conventional exponential decay of its amplitude. The complete model is constructed as follows:\\n1.  **Oscillatory Term:** A cosine function with the non-linear, time-dependent phase derived above: `cos(phi(t))`.\\n2.  **Phase Scaling:** To add flexibility, the strength of this phase saturation effect is controlled by a dimensionless parameter, `param2`. So, `phi(t) = param2 * (omega / gamma) * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`.\\n3.  **Amplitude Envelope:** The overall amplitude of this logarithmic oscillation decays exponentially, represented by `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n4.  **Overall Amplitude:** A final dimensionless parameter, `param1`, scales the entire logarithmic displacement `Y(t)`.\\n\\nCombining these elements, the expression for `Y(t)` is:\\n`Y(t) = param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(param2 * (omega / gamma) * (1 - exp(-gamma * t)))`\\n\\nThe final expression for the physical observable `x` is obtained by exponentiating `Y(t)` and scaling by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This model is dimensionally sound, as all terms within the `exp` and `cos` functions are dimensionless combinations of the physical variables. It provides a novel physical interpretation where damping causes not just energy loss but a fundamental deceleration of the oscillatory process itself.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(param2 * (omega / gamma) * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))))\\n</final_result>\"}",

The target variable `x` represents the system's position. Previous successful models have established a general structure consisting of a constant equilibrium position superimposed with a decaying sinusoidal oscillation. This \\\"additive\\\" framework, of the form `x(t) = x_equilibrium + x_transient(t)`, provides a strong baseline.\\n\\nHowever, a deeper physical insight suggests a more integrated relationship between the final equilibrium state and the transient oscillations. The additive models, such as `A * (param1 + exp(...))`, implicitly treat the amplitude of the transient oscillation (`A`) as being independent of the final equilibrium position (`param1 * A`). This implies that a system settling to a low equilibrium position could have the same magnitude of initial oscillation as one settling to a very high position, which may not be physically representative.\\n\\nI propose a \\\"multiplicative modulation\\\" model. In this framework, the system's behavior is viewed as a unified process converging to a final steady-state value, `x_eq`. The transient behavior is not simply added to this value but acts as a fractional modulation of it. The mathematical structure of this concept is `x(t) = x_eq * (1 + modulation(t))`.\\n\\nThis model is physically compelling for several reasons. It posits that the magnitude of the transient oscillations is inherently proportional to the final equilibrium value itself. A system whose equilibrium is further from the origin (a larger `x_eq`) will naturally exhibit proportionally larger oscillations as it settles. This principle is common in control systems and dynamic processes where the response characteristics scale with the operating point or setpoint.\\n\\nTo construct the specific formula based on this theory:\\n\\n1.  **Equilibrium State (`x_eq`):** The final, stable position of the system must be dimensionally consistent with position (`m`). The most direct way to construct this from the inputs is to make it proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. Thus, the equilibrium state is defined as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a single, dimensionless fitting parameter that sets the final resting position as a multiple of `A`.\\n\\n2.  **Modulation Term (`modulation(t)`):** This term must be a dimensionless, decaying oscillation that perturbs the `(1 + ...)` factor around unity.\\n    *   The decay envelope is governed by the damping factor, yielding the standard `exp(-gamma * t)` term.\\n    *   The oscillation is described by a cosine function, `cos(omega * t + phi)`. The frequency `omega` is used directly, avoiding the numerically unstable `sqrt(square(omega) - square(gamma))` term, which is a reasonable approximation for underdamped systems.\\n    *   The phase shift `phi` should not be a free parameter but an intrinsic property of the system. The phase response of a second-order system is fundamentally determined by the balance of its dissipative and reactive properties, quantified by the dimensionless damping ratio `gamma / omega`. Therefore, setting the phase shift to `phi = -arctan(gamma / omega)` provides a physically grounded model that captures the inherent lag caused by damping, without adding unnecessary complexity.\\n\\nCombining these elements yields a parsimonious and physically meaningful model. The formula describes a system whose oscillations are a dynamic, decaying fraction of its own final equilibrium value, with a phase response dictated by its fundamental physical constants.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * (1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t - arctan(gamma / omega)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

This model, `x(t) = A * exp(Y(t))`, inherently ensures `x > 0` and allows `x` to exceed `A` when `Y(t)` is positive, consistent with the data range. The value `A` thus represents the equilibrium state to which the system settles as `t -> ∞`, since the oscillatory term `Y(t)` will decay to zero.\\n\\nThe core of my theory lies in defining the dynamics of this logarithmic displacement, `Y(t)`. In a standard linear system, `Y(t)` would be a simple damped sinusoid: `Y(t) = C * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. However, previous models suggest that the interaction between the oscillatory (`omega`) and dissipative (`gamma`) components is more intricate.\\n\\nI hypothesize a \\\"Dynamic Phase Modulation\\\" mechanism. In this model, the damping process does not merely cause a monotonic decay of amplitude and a constant phase shift. Instead, the dissipative mechanism, characterized by its own timescale `1/gamma`, actively and periodically perturbs the phase of the primary oscillation. This implies that `gamma` should not be treated solely as a decay constant but also as the characteristic frequency of a secondary process coupled to the main oscillator.\\n\\nThis physical coupling manifests as a modulation of the phase angle of the primary oscillation. The total phase is no longer a linear function of time (`omega * t + const`), but includes a time-varying component whose frequency is `gamma`. The simplest and most direct way to model this is to add a sinusoidal term with frequency `gamma` to the phase argument of the primary oscillation.\\n\\nThe proposed mathematical structure for the logarithmic displacement `Y(t)` is therefore:\\n1.  **Amplitude Damping:** The overall amplitude of the logarithmic oscillation decays exponentially with time, governed by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. The initial magnitude is determined by a dimensionless parameter, `param1`.\\n2.  **Phase Modulation:** The core oscillatory term is `cos(Phase(t))`, where the total phase `Phase(t)` is a sum of the primary linear phase progression `omega * t` and a modulating term proportional to `sin(gamma * t)`.

This model is dimensionally sound, as all arguments of the transcendental functions are dimensionless. It provides a rich yet physically-grounded description of the system, where the interplay between energy storage (`omega`) and energy dissipation (`gamma`) is captured not as a simple sum or a constant phase shift, but as a dynamic, time-varying modulation of the system's oscillatory phase.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2 * sin(gamma * t)))\\n</final_result>\"}",

Analysis of the data and the successful example models reveals a consistent narrative: a system, initially at a displacement `x(0) = A`, is released from rest (`x'(0) = 0`) and subsequently evolves toward a new, stable equilibrium position `x_eq` that is greater than `A`, leading to the observed \\\"overshoot\\\" phenomenon.\\n\\nThe most physically rigorous example models capture this \\\"Forced Relaxation\\\" scenario with high fidelity, correctly employing the damped angular frequency `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` and enforcing the zero initial velocity condition, which rigidly links the cosine and sine components of the solution. These models operate on the foundational assumption that the new equilibrium `x_eq` is simply proportional to the system's characteristic scale, `A`, such that `x_eq = param1 * A`.\\n\\nThis analysis proposes a novel refinement to this theory, which we term **\\\"Damping-Modulated Equilibrium\\\"**. The core hypothesis is that the steady-state equilibrium position is not solely determined by the scale `A`, but is also subtly influenced by the intrinsic dissipative properties of the system itself. In many physical systems, the mechanism that creates a new equilibrium potential is not entirely independent of the mechanism that causes damping. For example, in a system driven by fluid flow, the final displacement might depend on the fluid's viscosity, which is also the source of damping.\\n\\nThe fundamental dimensionless quantity that characterizes the nature of damping in an oscillator is the damping ratio, `ζ = gamma / omega`. It is physically plausible that the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, has a dependency on this ratio. We can model this as a first-order correction to the simple proportional model. We therefore propose that the equilibrium position is given by:\\n\\n`x_eq = A * (param1 + param2 * (gamma / omega))`\\n\\nHere, `param1` retains its role as the primary scaling factor for the equilibrium, while the new dimensionless parameter, `param2`, quantifies the coupling strength between the system's damping characteristics and its final steady-state response.

The initial conditions uniquely determine the amplitude of the transient, decaying oscillatory term, `x(t) - x_eq`.\\n\\nThe resulting model represents a more nuanced physical hypothesis.

The output `x`, which is always positive and exhibits a \\\"rise-and-fall\\\" behavior after an initial stimulus, is likely not the oscillator's displacement but rather a measure of the energy or amplitude of its excited state. The observation that the maximum output can exceed the characteristic amplitude `A` points to a resonant amplification mechanism, where the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), related to the ratio `omega/gamma`, plays a crucial role.\\n\\nI propose a model of **\\\"Self-Inhibited Resonant Activation\\\"**.

This resonant gain is proportional to the Q-factor. Therefore, the potential peak amplitude scales with the dimensionless group `omega / gamma`. The overall scaling is set by `A`, leading to a potential amplitude term proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`. This term correctly predicts that a high-frequency, low-damping system will exhibit a much stronger response.\\n\\n2.  **Activation and Dissipation Dynamics:** After an initial impulse at `t=0`, the system's response `x` builds from zero. This activation is not instantaneous; it is a dynamic process that is fundamentally opposed by the system's own damping. We can model this as a first-order kinetic process, where the response approaches its potential. The fractional activation at time `t` is thus described by a saturating exponential term: `(1 - exp(-k * t))`. Crucially, the rate `k` of this activation process is governed by the same damping coefficient `gamma` that causes the final decay.\\n\\n    Simultaneously, the entire system is losing energy, causing the overall response to decay. This dissipation is modeled by the classic exponential decay envelope, `exp(-k * t)`. The core of the \\\"Self-Inhibition\\\" theory is that the same time constant governs both the resistance to activation and the long-term decay, as they both stem from the same underlying physical dissipative mechanism. This links the rise and fall of the response in a deeply physical way.\\n\\n3.  **The Combined Model:** The final observed response `x(t)` is the product of the potential amplitude and the combined activation/dissipation dynamics.

The key characteristics of the output `x`—its strict positivity, its rise from zero to a single peak followed by a decay, and its potential for amplification (peak value exceeding the input amplitude `A`)—guide the formulation of a new theoretical model. This model, which I term the **Phase-Saturated Impulse Response**, posits that the observed output is the product of a saturating phase-driven activation and an exponential energy decay.\\n\\n1.  **Excitation and Phase Evolution:** Upon receiving an impulse at `t=0`, the system is excited. In the abstract phase space of the oscillator (e.g., a plot of position vs. momentum), the state of the system begins to evolve. The primary characteristic of this evolution is rotation, the speed of which is governed by the system's natural angular frequency, `omega`. The total phase angle accumulated by time `t` is therefore proportional to `omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Saturated Observation of Phase:** We hypothesize that the measured quantity `x` is not the displacement itself but rather an observable that depends on this phase evolution in a saturating manner. As the phase angle `omega * t` increases from zero, the observable response grows. However, any real physical measurement or response mechanism has inherent limits and cannot grow indefinitely. The hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) function used in an example models one type of saturation, but another equally compelling physical model is one based on angular observation. The **arctangent function**, `arctan(z)`, provides a perfect mathematical analogy for such a process. It maps an input `z` that grows from zero to infinity (representing the cumulative phase `omega * t`) onto a bounded output that smoothly transitions from 0 to a finite limit (π/2). This `arctan(omega * t)` term elegantly models the system's \\\"ringing up\\\" phase, where the response grows rapidly at first and then smoothly saturates as it reaches its maximum activation level.\\n\\n3.  **Exponential Energy Decay:** Concurrently with the phase evolution, the total energy of the system is dissipated due to damping forces, a process characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This energy loss is universally modeled by an exponential decay factor, `exp(-k * gamma * t)`, which ensures that the system's response ultimately returns to zero as `t → ∞`.\\n\\n4.  **The Combined Response:** The observed output `x(t)` is the result of the interplay between the phase-driven activation and the energy decay. By modeling the response as the product of these two terms, scaled by the base amplitude `A`, we obtain a function that naturally reproduces the desired characteristics. The product of the monotonically increasing, saturating `arctan` function and the monotonically decreasing `exp` function yields a curve that starts at zero, rises to a single, well-defined peak, and then decays.\\n\\nThis model provides a clear mechanism for amplification. The peak of the response occurs when the rate of rise from the `arctan` term is balanced by the rate of fall from the `exp` term. A system with a high natural frequency `omega` and low damping `gamma` (a high Quality Factor) will cause the `arctan` term to approach its saturation value of π/2 very quickly, long before the `exp(-gamma * t)` term has significantly decreased. This results in a peak amplitude that can be a substantial multiple of the base amplitude `A`, consistent with the observed data. The model is also dimensionally sound, as `A` provides the units of meters, while all other functional components are dimensionless.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * arctan(omega * t) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",

The behavior of `x`—starting from a value near zero, rising to a single peak, and then decaying asymptotically—is the classic signature of the *envelope* of a damped harmonic oscillator's response to an impulse at `t=0`. The fact that `x` is always positive confirms that it represents a non-oscillatory quantity like the magnitude of displacement or the stored energy, rather than the displacement itself.\\n\\nMy theoretical model is based on the concept of **\\\"Power-Law Resonant Activation\\\"**. I posit that the observed response `x(t)` is the result of two fundamental, competing processes: a resonant energy accumulation process that causes the response to grow, and a dissipative process that causes it to decay.\\n\\n1.  **Exponential Dissipation:** Any real-world oscillator loses energy to its environment. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most fundamental mathematical description of this energy loss is an exponential decay. This dissipation acts as a time-dependent upper bound on the system's response, and it is modeled by the term `exp(-gamma * t)`. This ensures that for large `t`, the response always returns to zero.\\n\\n2.  **Power-Law Activation:** Following the initial stimulus at `t=0`, the system does not respond instantaneously. It must undergo oscillations to absorb energy and build up a macroscopic response. The rate and manner of this build-up are intrinsically linked to its natural frequency, `omega`. I propose that the most natural measure of the system's progress in this activation phase is the total phase that has elapsed, `φ = omega * t`. This dimensionless quantity represents \\\"how much oscillation has occurred.\\\"\\n\\n    Unlike models that assume a saturating activation (like `arctan` or `tanh`), I theorize that the growth of the response envelope follows a more fundamental power-law relationship with the accumulated phase. The activation factor is thus modeled as `(omega * t)^n`. This functional form is incredibly versatile and physically significant, appearing in various phenomena from critical point physics to polymer chain growth.\\n    *   The term `(omega * t)` correctly captures that a higher frequency `omega` leads to a faster rise in the response.\\n    *   The exponent `n` (which we will represent as an optimizable parameter, `param2`) is a \\\"growth index\\\" that characterizes the non-linearity of the energy accumulation.

A crucial observation, consistent with previous successful models, is that the output `x` is always positive. This strongly supports a model structure of the form `x(t) = A * exp(Y(t))`. In this framework, `A` represents a baseline or equilibrium amplitude, while `Y(t) = log(x/A)` is a dimensionless quantity representing the logarithmic displacement from this baseline. The core of the modeling challenge lies in finding the correct physical description for the dynamics of `Y(t)`.\\n\\nStandard models of damped oscillators often assume that all physical parameters, such as the damping coefficient `gamma`, represent processes that are fully and instantaneously active from the moment `t=0`. My proposed theory, which I term the **\\\"Transient Damping Engagement\\\" model**, challenges this idealization. I hypothesize that the dissipative mechanism within the system is not instantaneous but requires a finite amount of time to become fully effective.\\n\\nThis concept has a strong physical basis. Imagine an oscillator submerged in a viscous fluid (a dashpot). When motion begins, the fluid's resistance does not appear instantly; it takes time for the flow patterns that cause steady-state drag to establish. Similarly, in structural damping, it may take several cycles for internal friction to reach its characteristic level. This initial phase represents a transient \\\"engagement\\\" period for the damping process.\\n\\nTo model this mathematically, I propose that the amplitude of the logarithmic displacement, `Y(t)`, is a product of two competing effects: the standard exponential decay `exp(-gamma * t)` and a \\\"turn-on\\\" function that models the gradual engagement of the damping mechanism. The canonical function to describe such a gradual onset process that starts at zero and asymptotically approaches one is `f(t) = (1 - exp(-t/τ))`, where `τ` is the characteristic time constant of the engagement process.\\n\\nFor this model to be self-contained, the time constant `τ` should be determined by the system's intrinsic properties. The most relevant physical time scale associated with the damping process itself is `1/gamma`. Therefore, I define `τ` to be proportional to this time scale, introducing a dimensionless parameter `param2` to capture system-specific variations: `τ = param2 / gamma`.\\n\\nCombining these elements, the amplitude of the logarithmic displacement is not a simple decaying exponential, but rather a function that first rises and then falls: `Amplitude(t) = (1 - exp(-gamma * t / param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)`. This function is zero at `t=0`, rises to a peak at a time `t_peak > 0`, and then decays towards zero. This behavior starkly contrasts with standard models where the amplitude is maximal at `t=0`.\\n\\nThe complete expression for the logarithmic displacement `Y(t)` incorporates this new amplitude dynamic with the standard oscillatory term `cos(omega * t)` and an overall scaling factor `param1`:\\n\\n`Y(t) = param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t / param2)) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`\\n\\nThis model provides a rich physical picture: upon initiation, the system's oscillatory energy builds up faster than the nascent dissipative forces can remove it, causing the logarithmic displacement to grow. As the damping mechanism fully engages, dissipation overtakes the system, and the oscillations decay as expected. The model is dimensionally sound and offers a novel, physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena that is distinct from non-linear saturation or phase-modification theories.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = A * exp(param1 * (1 - exp(-gamma * t / param2)) * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\\n</final_result>\"}",

While effective, this approach treats the gain `param1` as a purely empirical factor. I propose a more physically nuanced theory, which I term the **\\\"Q-Factor Amplified Response Model\\\"**.\\n\\nThis model is based on the principle that the steady-state response of an oscillator to an external influence is often not independent of its intrinsic dynamic properties. Specifically, the \\\"Quality Factor\\\" or \\\"Q-factor\\\" of an oscillator, which measures the ratio of its stored energy to the energy dissipated per cycle, is a crucial determinant of its response amplitude near resonance. A high-Q system (low damping) can exhibit a much larger response than a low-Q system (high damping). The Q-factor is fundamentally related to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`.\\n\\nMy theory posits the following physical scenario:\\n1.  The system is initially held in a stable state at a displacement `x(0) = A`. This represents a baseline or initial condition.\\n2.  At time `t=0`, a constant forcing is applied, which shifts the system's stable equilibrium point to a new value, `x_eq`.\\n3.  Crucially, I hypothesize that this new equilibrium `x_eq` is not just a simple scaling of `A`, but is composed of the baseline `A` plus an additional displacement that is amplified by the system's Q-factor. This leads to the formulation:\\n    `x_eq = A + A * param1 * (omega / gamma)`\\n    `x_eq = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\\n    Here, `param1` is a dimensionless constant that modulates the strength of this Q-factor amplification. This formulation provides a physical justification for the large overshoot: systems with low damping `gamma` relative to their frequency `omega` will naturally settle at a much higher equilibrium position.\\n\\n4.  The system is released from rest at `t=0`, so its initial velocity is `x'(0) = 0`. The subsequent motion `x(t)` describes the transient dynamics as the system moves from `x(0)` to `x_eq`.\\n\\nThe general solution for a damped oscillator moving from an initial state `x(0)` to a new equilibrium `x_eq` with zero initial velocity is:\\n`x(t) = x_eq + (x(0) - x_eq) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma / omega) * sin(omega * t))`\\n\\nSubstituting our expressions for `x(0)` and `x_eq`:\\n*   `x(0) - x_eq = A - A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) = -A * param1 * omega / gamma`\\n\\nThis leads to the final expression.

Instead, the amplitude grows from zero, reaches a peak as energy permeates the system's oscillatory mode, and subsequently decays as energy is dissipated.\\n\\nThis physical narrative is mathematically captured by a function of the form `t * exp(-kt)`. My proposed model builds upon this structure:\\n\\n1.  **Initial Growth Phase:** The initial rate at which the amplitude grows is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency allows the system to respond more rapidly to the initial excitation. This growth is modeled by a term proportional to `omega * t`. The base scaling is provided by `A`, giving a growth term of `A * omega * t`.\\n\\n2.  **Exponential Damping:** As in any dissipative system, the amplitude eventually decays. This process is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`, leading to the classic exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\\n\\nCombining these two effects yields a model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)`. The function starts at `x(0)=0`, rises to a peak, and then decays towards zero for large `t`, remaining positive throughout.

This energy loss is governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. The most natural mathematical representation for this process is an exponential decay function, `exp(-gamma * t)`. This term correctly models the long-term behavior where the system's excitation fades away, ensuring `x` approaches zero as `t` becomes large.\\n\\n2.  **Activation Process:** When the system is stimulated at `t=0`, its response is not instantaneous.

Many physical systems exhibit this behavior, where the response rate is initially high but then levels off as the system approaches its maximum capacity. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the canonical mathematical function for describing such a smooth, saturating process. It starts at `0` and gracefully rises to an asymptote at `1`.\\n\\nI hypothesize that the rate of this activation is dictated by the system's natural frequency, `omega`. A higher frequency `omega` implies a more responsive system, capable of a faster \\\"turn-on\\\". Therefore, the argument of the `tanh` function should be proportional to `omega * t`. This creates an activation term of the form `tanh(param * omega * t)`.\\n\\n**The Combined Model:**\\n\\nThe complete response `x(t)` is the product of these two components, scaled by the initial amplitude factor `A`. The `tanh` function governs the initial rise from zero, while the `exp` function imposes the eventual decay. The interplay between the rising `tanh` term and the falling `exp` term naturally creates the single peak observed in the data.\\n\\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative: `x(t)` represents the system's mobilized response at time `t`. Initially, the response grows as the system is activated (`tanh` dominates). Simultaneously, dissipation begins its work (`exp` is always active). The response peaks when the rate of activation levels off and is overtaken by the rate of decay. Finally, as activation saturates (`tanh` approaches 1), the long-term behavior is dictated purely by the exponential dissipation. This \\\"activation-dissipation\\\" model is dimensionally sound and offers a physically distinct and plausible alternative to bi-exponential decay models.\\n\\n### Mathematical Formula\\n<final_result>\\nx = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega * t) * exp(-gamma * t)\\n</final_result>\"}",
