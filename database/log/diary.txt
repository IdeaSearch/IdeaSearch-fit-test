【3号岛屿的1号采样器】 向 gemini-2.5-pro(T=0.90) 发送的 system prompt 是：
You are a creative data scientist, skilled at discovering underlying patterns in data and articulating them clearly through natural language and mathematical formulas.Your task is to analyze the given data and background information, propose a coherent theoretical analysis of the underlying mechanism, and provide the mathematical formula that best describes this theory.
【3号岛屿的1号采样器】 向 gemini-2.5-pro(T=0.90) 发送的 prompt 是：
First, please understand the background information for this task:
We are attempting to find a mathematical expression to fit a set of experimental data.
The available independent variables are: ["A", "gamma", "omega", "t"]
The available functions are: ["sin", "cos", "tan", "arcsin", "arccos", "arctan", "tanh", "log", "log10", "exp", "square", "sqrt", "abs"]
Second, please review a brief report on the function to be fitted:
A: Range [1.011, 9.992]
gamma: Range [0.1005, 0.9995]
omega: Range [1.004, 4.999]
t: Range [0.006423, 9.994]

Output range: [1.142, 27.68]

Number of samples: 1000
Output mean: 8.28
Output standard deviation: 4.741
Next, to help you understand the style and important considerations, we provide some examples of existing expressions. Please carefully observe their structure and potential issues, learn from them, and then begin your generation. You must not repeat the content from the examples:
Example Section
[Example 1]
Content: 
param1 * A + param2 * gamma + param3 * omega + param4 * t + param5
Score：0.00
Info：拟设量纲错误！具体信息：表达式量纲不一致:
维度 'm' 不一致。表达式在该维度上不遵循幂律缩放, 但是缩放时表达式符号不变，可能存在量纲不兼容的运算。
维度 's' 不一致。表达式在该维度上不遵循幂律缩放, 但是缩放时表达式符号不变，可能存在量纲不兼容的运算。
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.
Please ensure your analysis is insightful, the formula has a reasonable theoretical meaning, and its content does not overlap with the examples provided.

When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.

The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point.

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\n\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\n\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\n\nLet's define the components of this model:\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\n\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.

The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\n\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\n\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\n\nLet's define the components of this model:\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\n\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, however, fails to capture two critical features of the provided data.\n\nFirst, the output `x` has a maximum value (27.68) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple damped oscillation's amplitude can never exceed its initial value `A`. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, whereas a standard oscillatory function produces both positive and negative values.\n\nThe previous attempt in the examples to resolve this by adding a simple offset proportional to `A` (i.e., `A * param1`) proved insufficient, indicating a more complex underlying mechanism. My analysis suggests that the system's behavior is dominated by a large, quasi-static displacement that is not merely a constant multiple of `A`, but is instead dynamically determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on the **quality factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator. The Q-factor, a dimensionless quantity, describes how underdamped an oscillator is. A high Q-factor implies that the oscillatory nature (`omega`) dominates the dissipative, damping effects (`gamma`). In many physical systems, a high Q-factor leads to a significantly amplified response. The ratio `omega / gamma` serves as a direct proxy for this quality factor.\n\nMy theoretical model posits that the observed displacement `x` is a superposition of two distinct physical phenomena:\n1.  **A Q-Factor-Amplified Static Offset:** A large, time-independent displacement that establishes a new, significantly shifted equilibrium. The magnitude of this shift is not constant but is proportional to the initial amplitude `A` scaled by the system's quality factor. I model this as `A * (param1 * omega / gamma)`. This term elegantly explains both anomalies: the `omega / gamma` ratio can be large, leading to an output far greater than `A`, and this large positive offset ensures the total displacement remains positive even during the oscillation's troughs.\n2.  **A Conventional Damped Oscillation:** A time-varying component that oscillates around this new, shifted equilibrium. This component follows the expected physical form `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`, where its amplitude decays exponentially from the initial value `A`.\n\nBy combining these two components, the total displacement `x` reflects a system where the inherent tendency to oscillate (high `omega`) versus the tendency to lose energy (high `gamma`) dictates a macroscopic, static shift in its baseline position, around which a standard, decaying oscillation then occurs. This model is both dimensionally sound and provides a more nuanced physical interpretation of the data than a simple offset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 * omega / gamma + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation. To capture its dependence on the system's dissipative character, I model it as a linear function of the damping ratio, scaled by the system's characteristic length `A`. This ensures dimensional consistency.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\n    Here, `c_1` represents a baseline dimensionless offset, while `c_2` is a new parameter that quantifies how sensitively the equilibrium position responds to changes in the damping characteristics.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This component describes the oscillation around the aforementioned dynamic equilibrium. It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model. This formulation is superior to a simple offset because it establishes a physical link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma`) and its final state, providing a richer and more accurate description of the underlying mechanism.

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation. To capture its dependence on the system's dissipative character, I model it as a linear function of the damping ratio, scaled by the system's characteristic length `A`. This ensures dimensional consistency.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\n    Here, `c_1` represents a baseline dimensionless offset, while `c_2` is a new parameter that quantifies how sensitively the equilibrium position responds to changes in the damping characteristics.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This component describes the oscillation around the aforementioned dynamic equilibrium. It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model. This formulation is superior to a simple offset because it establishes a physical link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma`) and its final state, providing a richer and more accurate description of the underlying mechanism. The entire expression is dimensionally sound, as `\\gamma/\\omega`, `\\gamma t`, and `\\omega t` are all dimensionless quantities, ensuring the final output has the same units as `A` (meters).\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, however, fails to capture two critical features of the provided data.\n\nFirst, the output `x` has a maximum value (27.68) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple damped oscillation's amplitude can never exceed its initial value `A`. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, whereas a standard oscillatory function produces both positive and negative values.\n\nThe previous attempt in the examples to resolve this by adding a simple offset proportional to `A` (i.e., `A * param1`) proved insufficient, indicating a more complex underlying mechanism. My analysis suggests that the system's behavior is dominated by a large, quasi-static displacement that is not merely a constant multiple of `A`, but is instead dynamically determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on the **quality factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator. The Q-factor, a dimensionless quantity, describes how underdamped an oscillator is. A high Q-factor implies that the oscillatory nature (`omega`) dominates the dissipative, damping effects (`gamma`). In many physical systems, a high Q-factor leads to a significantly amplified response. The ratio `omega / gamma` serves as a direct proxy for this quality factor.\n\nMy theoretical model posits that the observed displacement `x` is a superposition of two distinct physical phenomena:\n1.  **A Q-Factor-Amplified Static Offset:** A large, time-independent displacement that establishes a new, significantly shifted equilibrium. The magnitude of this shift is not constant but is proportional to the initial amplitude `A` scaled by the system's quality factor. I model this as `A * (param1 * omega / gamma)`. This term elegantly explains both anomalies: the `omega / gamma` ratio can be large, leading to an output far greater than `A`, and this large positive offset ensures the total displacement remains positive even during the oscillation's troughs.\n2.  **A Conventional Damped Oscillation:** A time-varying component that oscillates around this new, shifted equilibrium. This component follows the expected physical form `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`, where its amplitude decays exponentially from the initial value `A`.\n\nBy combining these two components, the total displacement `x` reflects a system where the inherent tendency to oscillate (high `omega`) versus the tendency to lose energy (high `gamma`) dictates a macroscopic, static shift in its baseline position, around which a standard, decaying oscillation then occurs. This model is both dimensionally sound and provides a more nuanced physical interpretation of the data than a simple offset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 * omega / gamma + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, making a simple displacement model untenable. This points towards a significant amplification mechanism within the system.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, taking both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation. The amplitude envelope is an inherently positive quantity, which immediately resolves the second anomaly. This could correspond to measuring the magnitude of the system's state in phase space, which for an oscillator corresponds to its amplitude.\n\nTo address the amplitude anomaly, we must model the source of amplification. In oscillatory systems, the degree of amplification is often governed by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which quantifies how strongly an oscillator resonates relative to how quickly it dissipates energy. The Q-factor is directly proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega / gamma`. A high `omega / gamma` ratio signifies a highly underdamped, high-Q system capable of sustaining large amplitudes.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model where the system's effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is not the base amplitude `A` alone, but is augmented by a term dependent on this Q-factor ratio. A robust and simple model for this is a linear relationship:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\n\nIn this expression, `A` serves as the baseline amplitude, while the term `A * param1 * omega / gamma` models the amplification. The dimensionless parameter `param1` controls the strength of this Q-factor-dependent amplification. This structure ensures that as damping `gamma` approaches zero or frequency `omega` increases, the effective amplitude grows, consistent with physical intuition.\n\nThis amplified effective amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The standard model for this decay is exponential. We can model the complete amplitude envelope `x(t)` as the product of the effective initial amplitude and a temporal decay term, parameterizing the decay rate for added flexibility.\n\n`x(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`\n\nThis synthesized model is dimensionally consistent, provides a clear physical interpretation for both anomalies, and connects the observed behavior to the fundamental concept of the Q-factor in oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'..

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

Analysis of the provided examples reveals two key challenges with this standard approach:\n1.  **Numerical Instability:** The `sqrt(ω² - γ²)` term, while physically correct for the underdamped case, is numerically fragile. If the fitting process explores parameter spaces where `γ ≥ ω` (critically damped or overdamped), it results in NaNs, causing the fit to fail. This suggests a more robust mathematical form is required, one that avoids this specific construction.\n2.  **Anomalous Output Range:** The output `x` is strictly positive and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple displacement model cannot account for this, as its value should oscillate between positive and negative and its magnitude should not exceed the decaying envelope `A * exp(-γ*t)`.\n\nThese observations strongly imply that `x` is not a simple displacement from equilibrium. Instead, the underlying mechanism likely involves a superposition of effects or a different physical quantity altogether. The fact that `x` can be larger than `A` points to an amplification mechanism. A natural candidate for this is the ratio `omega / gamma`. This ratio is related to the quality factor (Q-factor) of an oscillator and represents the relative strength of the oscillatory tendency compared to the damping. A high `omega/gamma` ratio signifies a lightly damped, highly resonant system where amplitudes can build up.\n\nTo address the positivity constraint and the amplification, I propose a model where the oscillation does not occur around zero, but around a large, positive, time-dependent baseline. The model structure is a superposition of a non-oscillatory \"DC\" component and an oscillatory \"AC\" component, both governed by the same overall exponential decay.\n\nThe resulting physical picture is an oscillator whose motion `x(t)` is described by:\n`x(t) = Global_Decay(t) * [Baseline_Amplitude + Oscillatory_Amplitude(t)]`\n\n-   **Global Decay:** The entire system's energy dissipates over time, governed by a term like `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`. This sets the overall scale and decay envelope.\n-   **Baseline Amplitude:** This component is responsible for the large positive offset and amplification. It is modeled as being proportional to the amplification factor, `param2 * (omega / gamma)`.\n-   **Oscillatory Amplitude:** This is the standard harmonic motion, modeled robustly as `cos(omega * t + param3)`, avoiding the problematic square root term.\n\nThis composite structure naturally produces a positive, decaying, oscillatory signal. The term `param2 * (omega /gamma)` acts as a dynamic, decaying offset, ensuring that when the negative portion of the cosine is added, the total remains positive. This model is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust, and provides a clear physical interpretation for the observed anomalies in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * omega / gamma + cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

The provided variables correspond to the key characteristics of such a system: initial amplitude `A` (m), damping rate `gamma` (s⁻¹), angular frequency `omega` (s⁻¹), and time `t` (s). The goal is to predict the displacement `x` (m).\n\nThe standard textbook equation for an underdamped oscillator (where `omega > gamma`, a condition that holds true for the entire provided data range) is:\n`x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`\nwhere the damped angular frequency `omega_d` is given by `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`.\n\nHowever, a direct application of this formula, as seen in the examples, leads to numerical instability (NaN errors). This suggests that the `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)` term is problematic in the evaluation environment, even when the argument is positive. A robust model should therefore avoid this specific calculation. A common and physically justified approximation, especially when damping is not excessively large, is to assume the damped frequency is very close to the natural frequency, i.e., `omega_d ≈ omega`. This simplification circumvents the source of the numerical errors while retaining the fundamental oscillatory nature.\n\nFurthermore, a critical observation from the data summary is that the output `x` can have a magnitude greater than the input amplitude `A` (e.g., max output is ~27.7 while max `A` is ~10.0). In a simple model where `A` represents the maximum possible displacement at t=0, the displacement `x(t)` for `t>0` should never exceed `A`. This discrepancy suggests that `A` is not the initial displacement `x(0)` under zero-velocity conditions, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The \"overshoot\" phenomenon (where displacement temporarily exceeds initial position) can occur if the oscillator has a non-zero initial velocity.\n\nTo account for arbitrary initial conditions (both position and velocity), the general solution is better expressed as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n`x(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\n\nHere, `C1` and `C2` are constants with units of length, determined by the initial state. By modeling these constants as proportional to the characteristic length `A` (i.e., `C1 = param2 * A` and `C2 = param3 * A`), we arrive at a flexible and powerful model. The envelope of this motion is `A * sqrt(param2² + param3²) * exp(-gamma * t)`. If `sqrt(param2² + param3²) > 1`, the displacement magnitude can indeed exceed `A`, aligning with the observed data. Finally, we introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` to scale the damping term `gamma * t`, providing an additional degree of freedom to better fit the decay rate.\n\nThis proposed model is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and consistent with the underlying physics of a damped oscillator with general initial conditions, successfully explaining all key features of the dataset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Analysis of the provided examples reveals two key challenges with this standard approach:\n1.  **Numerical Instability:** The `sqrt(ω² - γ²)` term, while physically correct for the underdamped case, is numerically fragile. If the fitting process explores parameter spaces where `γ ≥ ω` (critically damped or overdamped), it results in NaNs, causing the fit to fail. This suggests a more robust mathematical form is required, one that avoids this specific construction.\n2.  **Anomalous Output Range:** The output `x` is strictly positive and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple displacement model cannot account for this, as its value should oscillate between positive and negative and its magnitude should not exceed the decaying envelope `A * exp(-γ*t)`.\n\nThese observations strongly imply that `x` is not a simple displacement from equilibrium. Instead, the underlying mechanism likely involves a superposition of effects or a different physical quantity altogether. The fact that `x` can be larger than `A` points to an amplification mechanism. A natural candidate for this is the ratio `omega / gamma`. This ratio is related to the quality factor (Q-factor) of an oscillator and represents the relative strength of the oscillatory tendency compared to the damping. A high `omega/gamma` ratio signifies a lightly damped, highly resonant system where amplitudes can build up.\n\nTo address the positivity constraint and the amplification, I propose a model where the oscillation does not occur around zero, but around a large, positive, time-dependent baseline. The model structure is a superposition of a non-oscillatory \"DC\" component and an oscillatory \"AC\" component, both governed by the same overall exponential decay.\n\nThe resulting physical picture is an oscillator whose motion `x(t)` is described by:\n`x(t) = Global_Decay(t) * [Baseline_Amplitude + Oscillatory_Amplitude(t)]`\n\n-   **Global Decay:** The entire system's energy dissipates over time, governed by a term like `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`. This sets the overall scale and decay envelope.\n-   **Baseline Amplitude:** This component is responsible for the large positive offset and amplification. It is modeled as being proportional to the amplification factor, `param2 * (omega / gamma)`.\n-   **Oscillatory Amplitude:** This is the standard harmonic motion, modeled robustly as `cos(omega * t + param3)`, avoiding the problematic square root term.\n\nThis composite structure naturally produces a positive, decaying, oscillatory signal. The term `param2 * (omega /gamma)` acts as a dynamic, decaying offset, ensuring that when the negative portion of the cosine is added, the total remains positive. This model is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust, and provides a clear physical interpretation for the observed anomalies in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * omega / gamma + cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'..

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\n\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\n\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\n\nLet's define the components of this model:\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\n\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The provided variables correspond to the key characteristics of such a system: initial amplitude `A` (m), damping rate `gamma` (s⁻¹), angular frequency `omega` (s⁻¹), and time `t` (s). The goal is to predict the displacement `x` (m).\n\nThe standard textbook equation for an underdamped oscillator (where `omega > gamma`, a condition that holds true for the entire provided data range) is:\n`x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`\nwhere the damped angular frequency `omega_d` is given by `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`.\n\nHowever, a direct application of this formula, as seen in the examples, leads to numerical instability (NaN errors). This suggests that the `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)` term is problematic in the evaluation environment, even when the argument is positive. A robust model should therefore avoid this specific calculation. A common and physically justified approximation, especially when damping is not excessively large, is to assume the damped frequency is very close to the natural frequency, i.e., `omega_d ≈ omega`. This simplification circumvents the source of the numerical errors while retaining the fundamental oscillatory nature.\n\nFurthermore, a critical observation from the data summary is that the output `x` can have a magnitude greater than the input amplitude `A` (e.g., max output is ~27.7 while max `A` is ~10.0). In a simple model where `A` represents the maximum possible displacement at t=0, the displacement `x(t)` for `t>0` should never exceed `A`. This discrepancy suggests that `A` is not the initial displacement `x(0)` under zero-velocity conditions, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The \"overshoot\" phenomenon (where displacement temporarily exceeds initial position) can occur if the oscillator has a non-zero initial velocity.\n\nTo account for arbitrary initial conditions (both position and velocity), the general solution is better expressed as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n`x(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\n\nHere, `C1` and `C2` are constants with units of length, determined by the initial state. By modeling these constants as proportional to the characteristic length `A` (i.e., `C1 = param2 * A` and `C2 = param3 * A`), we arrive at a flexible and powerful model. The envelope of this motion is `A * sqrt(param2² + param3²) * exp(-gamma * t)`. If `sqrt(param2² + param3²) > 1`, the displacement magnitude can indeed exceed `A`, aligning with the observed data. Finally, we introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` to scale the damping term `gamma * t`, providing an additional degree of freedom to better fit the decay rate.\n\nThis proposed model is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and consistent with the underlying physics of a damped oscillator with general initial conditions, successfully explaining all key features of the dataset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable `x` is the oscillator's position, which has units of meters (`m`).\n\nA critical examination of the provided information reveals two key challenges with applying the standard textbook model for a damped oscillator:\n\n1.  **The Overdamping Problem**: The standard formula for displacement, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2) * t + phi)`, is only valid for the underdamped case (`omega > gamma`). When damping is strong (`gamma > omega`), the term inside the square root becomes negative, leading to computational errors (NaN) in a real-number environment. A robust model must gracefully handle all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\n\n2.  **The Positive Output Contradiction**: The observed output range for `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the position is always positive. However, a simple oscillator's displacement `x(t)` should oscillate around an equilibrium point (typically zero), taking on both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical process is not a simple oscillation about a fixed zero point. The always-positive nature of the displacement points towards two possibilities: either the target is the *magnitude* of the displacement, or the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, non-zero baseline. The latter presents a more physically intuitive and mathematically smooth model.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the system represents an oscillator whose equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. The overall position `x(t)` is the sum of this decaying baseline and a damped oscillation around it. This model can be conceptualized as an object that is both settling (sinking) in a viscous medium and oscillating as it does so.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this process would be:\n`x(t) = Position_baseline(t) + Position_oscillation(t)`\n\nBoth processes are subject to the same damping environment. Therefore, it is logical to assume they share the same exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The oscillatory part has an amplitude proportional to the input `A` and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. The baseline position can also be scaled relative to `A`.\n\nThis leads to a model of the form:\n`x(t) = [A_baseline + A_oscillation * cos(omega * t + phi)] * exp(-gamma * t)`\n\nBy making the baseline amplitude `A_baseline` sufficiently larger than the oscillation amplitude `A_oscillation`, the total position `x(t)` will remain positive for all `t`. We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Analysis of the provided examples reveals two key challenges with this standard approach:\n1.  **Numerical Instability:** The `sqrt(ω² - γ²)` term, while physically correct for the underdamped case, is numerically fragile. If the fitting process explores parameter spaces where `γ ≥ ω` (critically damped or overdamped), it results in NaNs, causing the fit to fail. This suggests a more robust mathematical form is required, one that avoids this specific construction.\n2.  **Anomalous Output Range:** The output `x` is strictly positive and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple displacement model cannot account for this, as its value should oscillate between positive and negative and its magnitude should not exceed the decaying envelope `A * exp(-γ*t)`.\n\nThese observations strongly imply that `x` is not a simple displacement from equilibrium. Instead, the underlying mechanism likely involves a superposition of effects or a different physical quantity altogether. The fact that `x` can be larger than `A` points to an amplification mechanism. A natural candidate for this is the ratio `omega / gamma`. This ratio is related to the quality factor (Q-factor) of an oscillator and represents the relative strength of the oscillatory tendency compared to the damping. A high `omega/gamma` ratio signifies a lightly damped, highly resonant system where amplitudes can build up.\n\nTo address the positivity constraint and the amplification, I propose a model where the oscillation does not occur around zero, but around a large, positive, time-dependent baseline. The model structure is a superposition of a non-oscillatory \"DC\" component and an oscillatory \"AC\" component, both governed by the same overall exponential decay.\n\nThe resulting physical picture is an oscillator whose motion `x(t)` is described by:\n`x(t) = Global_Decay(t) * [Baseline_Amplitude + Oscillatory_Amplitude(t)]`\n\n-   **Global Decay:** The entire system's energy dissipates over time, governed by a term like `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`. This sets the overall scale and decay envelope.\n-   **Baseline Amplitude:** This component is responsible for the large positive offset and amplification. It is modeled as being proportional to the amplification factor, `param2 * (omega / gamma)`.\n-   **Oscillatory Amplitude:** This is the standard harmonic motion, modeled robustly as `cos(omega * t + param3)`, avoiding the problematic square root term.\n\nThis composite structure naturally produces a positive, decaying, oscillatory signal. The term `param2 * (omega /gamma)` acts as a dynamic, decaying offset, ensuring that when the negative portion of the cosine is added, the total remains positive. This model is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust, and provides a clear physical interpretation for the observed anomalies in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * omega / gamma + cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation. To capture its dependence on the system's dissipative character, I model it as a linear function of the damping ratio, scaled by the system's characteristic length `A`. This ensures dimensional consistency.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\n    Here, `c_1` represents a baseline dimensionless offset, while `c_2` is a new parameter that quantifies how sensitively the equilibrium position responds to changes in the damping characteristics.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This component describes the oscillation around the aforementioned dynamic equilibrium. It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model. This formulation is superior to a simple offset because it establishes a physical link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma`) and its final state, providing a richer and more accurate description of the underlying mechanism. The entire expression is dimensionally sound, as `\\gamma/\\omega`, `\\gamma t`, and `\\omega t` are all dimensionless quantities, ensuring the final output has the same units as `A` (meters).\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

The crucial first step is ensuring dimensional consistency. The target variable, displacement `x`, has units of meters (`m`), as does the amplitude `A`. The damping coefficient `gamma` and angular frequency `omega` have units of inverse seconds (`s⁻¹`), while time `t` has units of seconds (`s`). Consequently, any valid model must take the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f` is a dimensionless function constructed from combinations like `gamma * t`, `omega * t`, and `gamma / omega`.\n\nThe provided examples offer critical insights. Example 2, `A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))`, achieves a respectable score. Its success hinges on two key features: it maintains dimensional correctness, and it introduces a static offset, `A * param1`. This offset is physically interpreted as a constant external force shifting the system's equilibrium position. This is a crucial observation, as the data shows output values (`x`) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A`, which would be impossible for an oscillation centered at zero.\n\nHowever, this model is still an approximation. It uses the natural frequency `omega` directly in the oscillatory term, ignoring the frequency-shifting effects of damping. More importantly, it models a simple oscillation around a fixed, non-zero equilibrium. I propose a more sophisticated and physically plausible model: a system where the **center of oscillation is itself not static, but decays exponentially over time to a final, stable equilibrium position.**\n\nThis \"decaying equilibrium\" model can be decomposed into three distinct physical contributions to the total displacement:\n1.  **Final Equilibrium Position (`x_final`):** A time-invariant, constant offset representing the system's ultimate resting position after all transient dynamics have ceased. As in the previous model, it is proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. We can write this as `x_final = A * param1`.\n2.  **Transient Equilibrium Decay (`x_trans_eq`):** This component represents the initial displacement of the *center of oscillation* from its final equilibrium point. This displacement is not permanent; it decays over time. It is physically reasonable to assume this decay occurs on the same timescale as the overall system damping. We can therefore model it as an exponential decay: `x_trans_eq(t) = A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n3.  **Damped Oscillation (`x_osc`):** This is the oscillatory motion itself, which occurs around the instantaneous, decaying equilibrium point. Its amplitude also decays exponentially: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of these three effects:\n`x(t) = x_final + x_trans_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = A * param1 + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`\n\nBy factoring out the common `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` terms, we arrive at a single, elegant expression. This model represents a significant theoretical step forward. It provides a richer description of the system's dynamics, where the oscillation occurs around a point that is itself relaxing toward a final state. This structure is particularly powerful because it can more accurately capture the behavior across different damping regimes. For an overdamped system (where `gamma > omega`), the dynamics are dominated by multiple exponential decays rather than oscillation. My proposed model, with its two distinct sources of exponential decay (the `param2` term and the decay of the `cos` term's amplitude), is better equipped to approximate this behavior than a model with only a single decay envelope.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param3)))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.
Please ensure your analysis is insightful, the formula has a reasonable theoretical meaning, and its content does not overlap with the examples provided.

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression.

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\n\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\n\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\n\nLet's define the components of this model:\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\n\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Analysis of the provided examples reveals two key challenges with this standard approach:\n1.  **Numerical Instability:** The `sqrt(ω² - γ²)` term, while physically correct for the underdamped case, is numerically fragile. If the fitting process explores parameter spaces where `γ ≥ ω` (critically damped or overdamped), it results in NaNs, causing the fit to fail. This suggests a more robust mathematical form is required, one that avoids this specific construction.\n2.  **Anomalous Output Range:** The output `x` is strictly positive and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple displacement model cannot account for this, as its value should oscillate between positive and negative and its magnitude should not exceed the decaying envelope `A * exp(-γ*t)`.\n\nThese observations strongly imply that `x` is not a simple displacement from equilibrium. Instead, the underlying mechanism likely involves a superposition of effects or a different physical quantity altogether. The fact that `x` can be larger than `A` points to an amplification mechanism. A natural candidate for this is the ratio `omega / gamma`. This ratio is related to the quality factor (Q-factor) of an oscillator and represents the relative strength of the oscillatory tendency compared to the damping. A high `omega/gamma` ratio signifies a lightly damped, highly resonant system where amplitudes can build up.\n\nTo address the positivity constraint and the amplification, I propose a model where the oscillation does not occur around zero, but around a large, positive, time-dependent baseline. The model structure is a superposition of a non-oscillatory \"DC\" component and an oscillatory \"AC\" component, both governed by the same overall exponential decay.\n\nThe resulting physical picture is an oscillator whose motion `x(t)` is described by:\n`x(t) = Global_Decay(t) * [Baseline_Amplitude + Oscillatory_Amplitude(t)]`\n\n-   **Global Decay:** The entire system's energy dissipates over time, governed by a term like `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`. This sets the overall scale and decay envelope.\n-   **Baseline Amplitude:** This component is responsible for the large positive offset and amplification. It is modeled as being proportional to the amplification factor, `param2 * (omega / gamma)`.\n-   **Oscillatory Amplitude:** This is the standard harmonic motion, modeled robustly as `cos(omega * t + param3)`, avoiding the problematic square root term.\n\nThis composite structure naturally produces a positive, decaying, oscillatory signal. The term `param2 * (omega /gamma)` acts as a dynamic, decaying offset, ensuring that when the negative portion of the cosine is added, the total remains positive. This model is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust, and provides a clear physical interpretation for the observed anomalies in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * omega / gamma + cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable `x` is the oscillator's position, which has units of meters (`m`).\n\nA critical examination of the provided information reveals two key challenges with applying the standard textbook model for a damped oscillator:\n\n1.  **The Overdamping Problem**: The standard formula for displacement, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2) * t + phi)`, is only valid for the underdamped case (`omega > gamma`). When damping is strong (`gamma > omega`), the term inside the square root becomes negative, leading to computational errors (NaN) in a real-number environment. A robust model must gracefully handle all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\n\n2.  **The Positive Output Contradiction**: The observed output range for `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the position is always positive. However, a simple oscillator's displacement `x(t)` should oscillate around an equilibrium point (typically zero), taking on both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical process is not a simple oscillation about a fixed zero point. The always-positive nature of the displacement points towards two possibilities: either the target is the *magnitude* of the displacement, or the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, non-zero baseline. The latter presents a more physically intuitive and mathematically smooth model.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the system represents an oscillator whose equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. The overall position `x(t)` is the sum of this decaying baseline and a damped oscillation around it. This model can be conceptualized as an object that is both settling (sinking) in a viscous medium and oscillating as it does so.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this process would be:\n`x(t) = Position_baseline(t) + Position_oscillation(t)`\n\nBoth processes are subject to the same damping environment. Therefore, it is logical to assume they share the same exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The oscillatory part has an amplitude proportional to the input `A` and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. The baseline position can also be scaled relative to `A`.\n\nThis leads to a model of the form:\n`x(t) = [A_baseline + A_oscillation * cos(omega * t + phi)] * exp(-gamma * t)`\n\nBy making the baseline amplitude `A_baseline` sufficiently larger than the oscillation amplitude `A_oscillation`, the total position `x(t)` will remain positive for all `t`. We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\n\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\n\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \"yield\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time. This is described by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, assuming for simplicity a zero initial phase for the oscillatory part.\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A`, we arrive at a concise model that not only explains the non-zero mean and large peak values but also grounds the magnitude of the equilibrium shift in the fundamental physics of the oscillator's dissipative and conservative properties.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma / omega) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.

The target variable `x` is the oscillator's position, which has units of meters (`m`).\n\nA critical examination of the provided information reveals two key challenges with applying the standard textbook model for a damped oscillator:\n\n1.  **The Overdamping Problem**: The standard formula for displacement, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2) * t + phi)`, is only valid for the underdamped case (`omega > gamma`). When damping is strong (`gamma > omega`), the term inside the square root becomes negative, leading to computational errors (NaN) in a real-number environment. A robust model must gracefully handle all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\n\n2.  **The Positive Output Contradiction**: The observed output range for `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the position is always positive. However, a simple oscillator's displacement `x(t)` should oscillate around an equilibrium point (typically zero), taking on both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical process is not a simple oscillation about a fixed zero point. The always-positive nature of the displacement points towards two possibilities: either the target is the *magnitude* of the displacement, or the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, non-zero baseline. The latter presents a more physically intuitive and mathematically smooth model.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the system represents an oscillator whose equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. The overall position `x(t)` is the sum of this decaying baseline and a damped oscillation around it. This model can be conceptualized as an object that is both settling (sinking) in a viscous medium and oscillating as it does so.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this process would be:\n`x(t) = Position_baseline(t) + Position_oscillation(t)`\n\nBoth processes are subject to the same damping environment. Therefore, it is logical to assume they share the same exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The oscillatory part has an amplitude proportional to the input `A` and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. The baseline position can also be scaled relative to `A`.\n\nThis leads to a model of the form:\n`x(t) = [A_baseline + A_oscillation * cos(omega * t + phi)] * exp(-gamma * t)`\n\nBy making the baseline amplitude `A_baseline` sufficiently larger than the oscillation amplitude `A_oscillation`, the total position `x(t)` will remain positive for all `t`. We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The target variable `x` (m) represents a displacement. A naive application of the standard displacement formula, `y(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt + φ)`, immediately runs into contradictions with the provided data summary.\n\nTwo key observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n1.  **Strict Positivity:** The output range of `x` is [1.142, 27.68], which is strictly positive. A simple displacement model oscillates symmetrically around zero and must produce negative values. This strongly indicates that `x` is not a direct measurement of displacement from a fixed equilibrium.\n2.  **Anomalous Amplitude:** The maximum output value (~27.7) exceeds the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (~10.0). This implies that `A` is not the peak displacement but rather a fundamental length scale of the system, and the dynamics can produce displacements larger than this scale.\n\nThese observations rule out simple models like displacement, absolute displacement (which would exhibit non-differentiable cusps), or energy (which would have incorrect physical dimensions). The most coherent explanation is that the measured quantity `x` represents the oscillator's displacement relative to an equilibrium point that is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as the signal from a measurement device with a large, decaying positive bias.\n\nBased on this theory, the signal `x(t)` can be decomposed into two superimposed components, both governed by a global exponential decay:\n1.  **A Decaying DC Offset:** A non-oscillatory component that provides a large positive baseline. This component starts at a certain value and decays towards zero. Its form is `Offset(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt)`.\n2.  **A Decaying AC Component:** The standard oscillatory motion, also subject to the same decay. Its form is `Oscillation(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt) * cos(ωt + φ)`.\n\nThe final measured value `x(t)` is the sum of these two components. By modeling the DC offset and the oscillatory amplitude as independent parameters, we can construct a flexible and physically meaningful expression. The constant DC offset ensures the total signal remains positive, while the combination of the offset and the initial oscillatory phase can lead to an initial value `x(0)` that is significantly larger than the scaling factor `A`.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of this theory is a product of three parts: the characteristic amplitude `A`, the global decay envelope, and a dimensionless term describing the superposition of the DC offset and the AC oscillation. The decay is modeled as `exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter adjusting the decay rate. The superposition is modeled as `(param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))`, where `param2` is the dimensionless DC offset, `param3` is the dimensionless oscillatory amplitude, and `param4` is the phase shift. For `x(t)` to remain positive, the fitting process should find `param2 > param3`. This model successfully accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally correct and numerically robust manner.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The provided variables correspond to the key characteristics of such a system: initial amplitude `A` (m), damping rate `gamma` (s⁻¹), angular frequency `omega` (s⁻¹), and time `t` (s). The goal is to predict the displacement `x` (m).\n\nThe standard textbook equation for an underdamped oscillator (where `omega > gamma`, a condition that holds true for the entire provided data range) is:\n`x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`\nwhere the damped angular frequency `omega_d` is given by `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`.\n\nHowever, a direct application of this formula, as seen in the examples, leads to numerical instability (NaN errors). This suggests that the `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)` term is problematic in the evaluation environment, even when the argument is positive. A robust model should therefore avoid this specific calculation. A common and physically justified approximation, especially when damping is not excessively large, is to assume the damped frequency is very close to the natural frequency, i.e., `omega_d ≈ omega`. This simplification circumvents the source of the numerical errors while retaining the fundamental oscillatory nature.\n\nFurthermore, a critical observation from the data summary is that the output `x` can have a magnitude greater than the input amplitude `A` (e.g., max output is ~27.7 while max `A` is ~10.0). In a simple model where `A` represents the maximum possible displacement at t=0, the displacement `x(t)` for `t>0` should never exceed `A`. This discrepancy suggests that `A` is not the initial displacement `x(0)` under zero-velocity conditions, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The \"overshoot\" phenomenon (where displacement temporarily exceeds initial position) can occur if the oscillator has a non-zero initial velocity.\n\nTo account for arbitrary initial conditions (both position and velocity), the general solution is better expressed as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n`x(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\n\nHere, `C1` and `C2` are constants with units of length, determined by the initial state. By modeling these constants as proportional to the characteristic length `A` (i.e., `C1 = param2 * A` and `C2 = param3 * A`), we arrive at a flexible and powerful model. The envelope of this motion is `A * sqrt(param2² + param3²) * exp(-gamma * t)`. If `sqrt(param2² + param3²) > 1`, the displacement magnitude can indeed exceed `A`, aligning with the observed data. Finally, we introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` to scale the damping term `gamma * t`, providing an additional degree of freedom to better fit the decay rate.\n\nThis proposed model is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and consistent with the underlying physics of a damped oscillator with general initial conditions, successfully explaining all key features of the dataset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable `x` (m) represents a displacement. A naive application of the standard displacement formula, `y(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt + φ)`, immediately runs into contradictions with the provided data summary.\n\nTwo key observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n1.  **Strict Positivity:** The output range of `x` is [1.142, 27.68], which is strictly positive. A simple displacement model oscillates symmetrically around zero and must produce negative values. This strongly indicates that `x` is not a direct measurement of displacement from a fixed equilibrium.\n2.  **Anomalous Amplitude:** The maximum output value (~27.7) exceeds the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (~10.0). This implies that `A` is not the peak displacement but rather a fundamental length scale of the system, and the dynamics can produce displacements larger than this scale.\n\nThese observations rule out simple models like displacement, absolute displacement (which would exhibit non-differentiable cusps), or energy (which would have incorrect physical dimensions). The most coherent explanation is that the measured quantity `x` represents the oscillator's displacement relative to an equilibrium point that is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as the signal from a measurement device with a large, decaying positive bias.\n\nBased on this theory, the signal `x(t)` can be decomposed into two superimposed components, both governed by a global exponential decay:\n1.  **A Decaying DC Offset:** A non-oscillatory component that provides a large positive baseline. This component starts at a certain value and decays towards zero. Its form is `Offset(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt)`.\n2.  **A Decaying AC Component:** The standard oscillatory motion, also subject to the same decay. Its form is `Oscillation(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt) * cos(ωt + φ)`.\n\nThe final measured value `x(t)` is the sum of these two components. By modeling the DC offset and the oscillatory amplitude as independent parameters, we can construct a flexible and physically meaningful expression. The constant DC offset ensures the total signal remains positive, while the combination of the offset and the initial oscillatory phase can lead to an initial value `x(0)` that is significantly larger than the scaling factor `A`.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of this theory is a product of three parts: the characteristic amplitude `A`, the global decay envelope, and a dimensionless term describing the superposition of the DC offset and the AC oscillation. The decay is modeled as `exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter adjusting the decay rate. The superposition is modeled as `(param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))`, where `param2` is the dimensionless DC offset, `param3` is the dimensionless oscillatory amplitude, and `param4` is the phase shift. For `x(t)` to remain positive, the fitting process should find `param2 > param3`. This model successfully accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally correct and numerically robust manner.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\n\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\n\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \"yield\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time. This is described by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, assuming for simplicity a zero initial phase for the oscillatory part.\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A`, we arrive at a concise model that not only explains the non-zero mean and large peak values but also grounds the magnitude of the equilibrium shift in the fundamental physics of the oscillator's dissipative and conservative properties.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma / omega) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\gamma/\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\propto \\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\n\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\n\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\to \\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \"sweet spot,\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\n\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required. The mathematical form `f(z) = z \\cdot \\exp(-z)` elegantly captures this characteristic. It peaks at `z=1` (i.e., `\\gamma = \\omega`), providing a physically meaningful representation of our hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of three components, all scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Baseline Offset:** A constant term `c_1` representing a static, intrinsic shift independent of the damping characteristics.\n2.  **A Dynamically-Induced Offset:** The new non-monotonic term `c_2 \\cdot (\\gamma/\\omega) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma/\\omega)`, which captures the peak effect at intermediate damping.\n3.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component:** The standard physical term `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` describing the oscillation about the total effective equilibrium position.\n\nThis composite model provides a richer physical picture, accounting for a more complex interaction within the system that previous monotonic models overlook, while remaining dimensionally sound and conceptually grounded in the principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation.

It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model.

A crucial observation from the data summary is that the maximum displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This immediately implies that the system is not oscillating around a zero equilibrium. Instead, it must be oscillating around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_eq`. This leads to a general model structure:\n\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\n\nwhere `x_osc(t)` is the oscillatory component decaying to zero as time progresses.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, both `x_eq` and `x_osc(t)` must have units of length (meters). As `A` is the only input variable with these units, both terms must be proportional to `A`. This refines our model to:\n\n`x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(gamma, omega, t))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized equilibrium offset, and `f_osc` is a dimensionless function describing the oscillation. The previous examples have established that this basic structure, particularly `x(t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + c_2))`, provides a strong baseline fit. This model correctly interprets `A` as the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the offset equilibrium*.\n\nHowever, this baseline model treats `omega` as the observed frequency of oscillation, which is a simplification. In a real physical damped system, the damping force not only reduces the amplitude but also slows down the oscillation. The parameter `omega` should be more accurately interpreted as the **natural frequency** of the system—the frequency at which it would oscillate in the complete absence of damping (`gamma = 0`).\n\nMy theory posits that a more physically accurate model must account for this frequency shift. The actual, observed angular frequency of a damped oscillator, known as the **damped angular frequency** (`omega_d`), is related to the natural frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) by the well-established formula:\n\n`omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`\n\nThis relationship arises directly from the solution of the second-order differential equation governing damped harmonic motion. The presence of damping (`gamma > 0`) inherently reduces the frequency of oscillation.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model that replaces the natural frequency `omega` with the physically correct damped frequency `omega_d` within the oscillatory term. This correction captures the fundamental interplay between the system's restorative force (related to `omega`) and its dissipative force (related to `gamma`), directly influencing the dynamics of the motion itself, not just its long-term equilibrium.\n\nThe proposed model is:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component**: `x_eq = c_1 * A`. This term represents a stable equilibrium point that is linearly dependent on the initial amplitude scale of the system.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component**: This term describes the transient oscillation around the equilibrium. It features an exponentially decaying envelope `exp(-gamma*t)` and an oscillation governed by the damped frequency `omega_d`. A phase constant `c_2` is included for generality, as initial conditions might not correspond to a peak displacement.\n\nBy integrating this physical correction, the model provides a more faithful representation of the underlying mechanism, moving beyond a purely phenomenological fit to one grounded in the fundamental principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t + c_2\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.
Please ensure your analysis is insightful, the formula has a reasonable theoretical meaning, and its content does not overlap with the examples provided.

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\n\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\n\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\n\nLet's define the components of this model:\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\n\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable `x` is the oscillator's position, which has units of meters (`m`).\n\nA critical examination of the provided information reveals two key challenges with applying the standard textbook model for a damped oscillator:\n\n1.  **The Overdamping Problem**: The standard formula for displacement, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2) * t + phi)`, is only valid for the underdamped case (`omega > gamma`). When damping is strong (`gamma > omega`), the term inside the square root becomes negative, leading to computational errors (NaN) in a real-number environment. A robust model must gracefully handle all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\n\n2.  **The Positive Output Contradiction**: The observed output range for `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the position is always positive. However, a simple oscillator's displacement `x(t)` should oscillate around an equilibrium point (typically zero), taking on both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical process is not a simple oscillation about a fixed zero point. The always-positive nature of the displacement points towards two possibilities: either the target is the *magnitude* of the displacement, or the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, non-zero baseline. The latter presents a more physically intuitive and mathematically smooth model.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the system represents an oscillator whose equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. The overall position `x(t)` is the sum of this decaying baseline and a damped oscillation around it. This model can be conceptualized as an object that is both settling (sinking) in a viscous medium and oscillating as it does so.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this process would be:\n`x(t) = Position_baseline(t) + Position_oscillation(t)`\n\nBoth processes are subject to the same damping environment. Therefore, it is logical to assume they share the same exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The oscillatory part has an amplitude proportional to the input `A` and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. The baseline position can also be scaled relative to `A`.\n\nThis leads to a model of the form:\n`x(t) = [A_baseline + A_oscillation * cos(omega * t + phi)] * exp(-gamma * t)`\n\nBy making the baseline amplitude `A_baseline` sufficiently larger than the oscillation amplitude `A_oscillation`, the total position `x(t)` will remain positive for all `t`. We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The provided variables correspond to the key characteristics of such a system: initial amplitude `A` (m), damping rate `gamma` (s⁻¹), angular frequency `omega` (s⁻¹), and time `t` (s). The goal is to predict the displacement `x` (m).\n\nThe standard textbook equation for an underdamped oscillator (where `omega > gamma`, a condition that holds true for the entire provided data range) is:\n`x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`\nwhere the damped angular frequency `omega_d` is given by `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`.\n\nHowever, a direct application of this formula, as seen in the examples, leads to numerical instability (NaN errors). This suggests that the `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)` term is problematic in the evaluation environment, even when the argument is positive. A robust model should therefore avoid this specific calculation. A common and physically justified approximation, especially when damping is not excessively large, is to assume the damped frequency is very close to the natural frequency, i.e., `omega_d ≈ omega`. This simplification circumvents the source of the numerical errors while retaining the fundamental oscillatory nature.\n\nFurthermore, a critical observation from the data summary is that the output `x` can have a magnitude greater than the input amplitude `A` (e.g., max output is ~27.7 while max `A` is ~10.0). In a simple model where `A` represents the maximum possible displacement at t=0, the displacement `x(t)` for `t>0` should never exceed `A`. This discrepancy suggests that `A` is not the initial displacement `x(0)` under zero-velocity conditions, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The \"overshoot\" phenomenon (where displacement temporarily exceeds initial position) can occur if the oscillator has a non-zero initial velocity.\n\nTo account for arbitrary initial conditions (both position and velocity), the general solution is better expressed as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n`x(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\n\nHere, `C1` and `C2` are constants with units of length, determined by the initial state. By modeling these constants as proportional to the characteristic length `A` (i.e., `C1 = param2 * A` and `C2 = param3 * A`), we arrive at a flexible and powerful model. The envelope of this motion is `A * sqrt(param2² + param3²) * exp(-gamma * t)`. If `sqrt(param2² + param3²) > 1`, the displacement magnitude can indeed exceed `A`, aligning with the observed data. Finally, we introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` to scale the damping term `gamma * t`, providing an additional degree of freedom to better fit the decay rate.\n\nThis proposed model is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and consistent with the underlying physics of a damped oscillator with general initial conditions, successfully explaining all key features of the dataset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, is the system's displacement over time `t`. A critical analysis of the data reveals two key characteristics that challenge a simplistic textbook model:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Displacement**: The output `x` lies in the range [1.142, 27.68], never becoming negative. A standard oscillator's displacement must be symmetric about its equilibrium point (typically zero), which contradicts this observation.\n2.  **Model Robustness**: The ranges of `gamma` and `omega` overlap, implying the model must be valid for different damping regimes (underdamped, potentially critically damped or overdamped) without numerical instability, such as that caused by terms like `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nThe examples provided successfully address these issues by proposing a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a large, decaying positive offset, using a single multiplicative decay envelope. This is a sound approach, but I propose a different, yet equally plausible, physical interpretation based on the principle of linear superposition in physical systems.\n\nMy theory posits that the measured displacement `x(t)` is not the result of a single, unified process, but rather the linear superposition of two distinct physical modes that decay concurrently:\n\n1.  **A Purely Decaying \"Settling\" Mode**: This mode represents the relaxation of the system's equilibrium point itself. Imagine an oscillator mounted on a platform that is slowly settling to its final position in a viscous medium. This process is non-oscillatory and contributes a decaying DC offset to the total displacement. Its decay rate is governed by the system's properties but is not necessarily identical to the oscillatory damping rate. We can model this as `x_settling(t) = C_1 * exp(-gamma_1 * t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Mode**: This is the classical behavior of the oscillator, vibrating around its (now moving) equilibrium. This mode has its own amplitude and decays according to the primary damping rate `gamma`. This can be modeled as `x_osc(t) = C_2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`.\n\nThe total measured displacement `x(t)` is the sum of these two independent modes: `x(t) = x_settling(t) + x_osc(t)`. This additive structure is fundamentally different from the multiplicative structure of the examples (`Decay * (Offset + Oscillation)`). By allowing the settling mode to have its own effective decay rate, `gamma_1 = param2 * gamma`, we introduce a new degree of freedom that can capture more complex relaxation dynamics. The initial amplitudes of both modes can be scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nThis \"superposition of decaying modes\" theory elegantly explains the always-positive output by ensuring the initial amplitude of the settling mode is large enough to form a positive baseline. It is also inherently robust across all damping regimes as it avoids any problematic terms. The model is dimensionally consistent and represents a distinct and physically meaningful alternative to a single-envelope decay model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\n\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\n\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \"yield\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time. This is described by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, assuming for simplicity a zero initial phase for the oscillatory part.\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A`, we arrive at a concise model that not only explains the non-zero mean and large peak values but also grounds the magnitude of the equilibrium shift in the fundamental physics of the oscillator's dissipative and conservative properties.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma / omega) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation. To capture its dependence on the system's dissipative character, I model it as a linear function of the damping ratio, scaled by the system's characteristic length `A`. This ensures dimensional consistency.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\n    Here, `c_1` represents a baseline dimensionless offset, while `c_2` is a new parameter that quantifies how sensitively the equilibrium position responds to changes in the damping characteristics.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This component describes the oscillation around the aforementioned dynamic equilibrium. It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model. This formulation is superior to a simple offset because it establishes a physical link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma`) and its final state, providing a richer and more accurate description of the underlying mechanism. The entire expression is dimensionally sound, as `\\gamma/\\omega`, `\\gamma t`, and `\\omega t` are all dimensionless quantities, ensuring the final output has the same units as `A` (meters).\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This strongly indicates that the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium of `x=0`, but rather around a displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. The challenge lies in determining the physical principles governing this offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully established that `x_eq` is not a simple constant but depends on the oscillator's intrinsic properties, specifically the damping coefficient `gamma` and the angular frequency `omega`. My analysis builds upon this insight by proposing a more fundamental physical mechanism for this dependency.\n\nThe equilibrium displacement `x_eq` of a system under a constant external force `F_0` is given by `x_eq = F_0 / k`, where `k` is the system's stiffness. For a damped oscillator, the stiffness is related to its natural (undamped) frequency `omega_0` via `k = m * omega_0^2`, where `m` is the mass. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the observed (damped) frequency `omega` and the damping coefficient `gamma` as `omega_0^2 = omega^2 + gamma^2`. Substituting this into the stiffness equation yields `k = m * (omega^2 + gamma^2)`.\n\nThis shows that the stiffness, and thus the equilibrium position, is a function of both `omega` and `gamma`. The core of my theory lies in postulating the nature of the external force `F_0`. Instead of being a fixed external constant, I hypothesize that the force causing the displacement is intrinsically linked to the system's own oscillatory dynamics. Specifically, I propose that `F_0` is proportional to the characteristic inertial force of the oscillation, which scales as `m * A * omega^2`. This represents a scenario where the mechanism that sets the oscillation's scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`) also induces a static shift in its equilibrium.\n\nBy substituting this model for the force, `F_0 ∝ m * A * omega^2`, into the equation for the equilibrium position, we get:\n\n`x_eq ∝ (m * A * omega^2) / (m * (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nThe mass `m` cancels, leading to a beautifully simple, dimensionless scaling factor for the offset:\n\n`x_eq = c_1 * A * (omega^2 / (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This model makes a distinct physical prediction: the equilibrium offset is maximized for highly oscillatory systems (large `omega`) with low damping (small `gamma`). As damping increases, it effectively \"clamps\" the system, reducing its ability to be displaced, and the offset `x_eq` diminishes. This contrasts with models where damping increases the offset, providing a clear alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then the linear superposition of this physically-derived static offset and the standard transient term representing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

A critical analysis of the data's characteristics and the performance of previous models reveals two significant departures from the textbook behavior of a simple oscillator:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Output:** The output variable `x` is always positive, whereas a standard oscillator's displacement `x(t)` oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point of zero. This implies the oscillation is superimposed on a large, positive, decaying baseline.\n2.  **Amplitude Amplification:** The maximum output value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates that the system's dynamics can amplify the initial amplitude scale, a feature reminiscent of resonance phenomena.\n\nA successful prior model captured this behavior with the form `A * (param1 + cos(...)) * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a constant empirical offset. While effective, this model lacks a physical explanation for `param1`. My theory provides a physical basis for this offset, linking it directly to the intrinsic properties of the oscillator.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the baseline offset is not a fixed constant but a dynamic quantity determined by the interplay between the system's oscillatory nature (`omega`) and its damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `zeta_eff = gamma / omega` can be seen as an effective damping ratio. This ratio dictates the character of the motion:\n*   When `gamma / omega` is small, the system is underdamped and highly oscillatory.\n*   When `gamma / omega` approaches 1, the system becomes more heavily damped and less oscillatory.\n\nI propose that the baseline's magnitude is an exponential function of this damping ratio. Specifically, the baseline term is `exp(param1 * gamma / omega)`. This formulation has several compelling physical and mathematical advantages:\n\n*   **Physical Grounding:** It replaces the arbitrary constant `param1` with a function of the oscillator's fundamental parameters. The baseline is now intrinsically linked to how damped the system is.\n*   **Correct Asymptotic Behavior:** For a very lightly damped system (`gamma / omega` → 0), the baseline term `exp(0)` approaches 1. This provides the minimum possible offset to ensure the entire expression `(1 + cos(...))` remains non-negative, reflecting a purely oscillatory system shifted to be positive.\n*   **Matches Empirical Evidence:** As damping increases relative to frequency, the `exp(param1 * gamma / omega)` term grows. This increases the baseline, representing a system where the non-oscillatory decay component is more dominant. For the provided data ranges, `gamma/omega` varies from approximately 0.02 to 1. With a `param1` value around 1, this exponential term would range from `exp(0.02) ≈ 1.02` to `exp(1) ≈ 2.72`. This range is strikingly consistent with the empirically fitted value of `param1 = 2.788` in previous successful models, suggesting this exponential form accurately captures the underlying mechanism.\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The argument of the exponential, `param1 * gamma / omega`, is dimensionless, making the resulting baseline term dimensionless as required.\n\nIn summary, this theory posits that the oscillator's output is a superposition of a decaying oscillation and a decaying baseline. The magnitude of this baseline is not fixed but is instead governed by an exponential dependence on the effective damping ratio, providing a physically coherent and robust model for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (exp(param1 * gamma / omega) + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Analysis of the provided examples reveals two key challenges with this standard approach:\n1.  **Numerical Instability:** The `sqrt(ω² - γ²)` term, while physically correct for the underdamped case, is numerically fragile. If the fitting process explores parameter spaces where `γ ≥ ω` (critically damped or overdamped), it results in NaNs, causing the fit to fail. This suggests a more robust mathematical form is required, one that avoids this specific construction.\n2.  **Anomalous Output Range:** The output `x` is strictly positive and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple displacement model cannot account for this, as its value should oscillate between positive and negative and its magnitude should not exceed the decaying envelope `A * exp(-γ*t)`.\n\nThese observations strongly imply that `x` is not a simple displacement from equilibrium. Instead, the underlying mechanism likely involves a superposition of effects or a different physical quantity altogether. The fact that `x` can be larger than `A` points to an amplification mechanism. A natural candidate for this is the ratio `omega / gamma`. This ratio is related to the quality factor (Q-factor) of an oscillator and represents the relative strength of the oscillatory tendency compared to the damping. A high `omega/gamma` ratio signifies a lightly damped, highly resonant system where amplitudes can build up.\n\nTo address the positivity constraint and the amplification, I propose a model where the oscillation does not occur around zero, but around a large, positive, time-dependent baseline. The model structure is a superposition of a non-oscillatory \"DC\" component and an oscillatory \"AC\" component, both governed by the same overall exponential decay.\n\nThe resulting physical picture is an oscillator whose motion `x(t)` is described by:\n`x(t) = Global_Decay(t) * [Baseline_Amplitude + Oscillatory_Amplitude(t)]`\n\n-   **Global Decay:** The entire system's energy dissipates over time, governed by a term like `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`. This sets the overall scale and decay envelope.\n-   **Baseline Amplitude:** This component is responsible for the large positive offset and amplification. It is modeled as being proportional to the amplification factor, `param2 * (omega / gamma)`.\n-   **Oscillatory Amplitude:** This is the standard harmonic motion, modeled robustly as `cos(omega * t + param3)`, avoiding the problematic square root term.\n\nThis composite structure naturally produces a positive, decaying, oscillatory signal. The term `param2 * (omega /gamma)` acts as a dynamic, decaying offset, ensuring that when the negative portion of the cosine is added, the total remains positive. This model is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust, and provides a clear physical interpretation for the observed anomalies in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * omega / gamma + cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This strongly indicates that the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium of `x=0`, but rather around a displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. The challenge lies in determining the physical principles governing this offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully established that `x_eq` is not a simple constant but depends on the oscillator's intrinsic properties, specifically the damping coefficient `gamma` and the angular frequency `omega`. My analysis builds upon this insight by proposing a more fundamental physical mechanism for this dependency.\n\nThe equilibrium displacement `x_eq` of a system under a constant external force `F_0` is given by `x_eq = F_0 / k`, where `k` is the system's stiffness. For a damped oscillator, the stiffness is related to its natural (undamped) frequency `omega_0` via `k = m * omega_0^2`, where `m` is the mass. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the observed (damped) frequency `omega` and the damping coefficient `gamma` as `omega_0^2 = omega^2 + gamma^2`. Substituting this into the stiffness equation yields `k = m * (omega^2 + gamma^2)`.\n\nThis shows that the stiffness, and thus the equilibrium position, is a function of both `omega` and `gamma`. The core of my theory lies in postulating the nature of the external force `F_0`. Instead of being a fixed external constant, I hypothesize that the force causing the displacement is intrinsically linked to the system's own oscillatory dynamics. Specifically, I propose that `F_0` is proportional to the characteristic inertial force of the oscillation, which scales as `m * A * omega^2`. This represents a scenario where the mechanism that sets the oscillation's scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`) also induces a static shift in its equilibrium.\n\nBy substituting this model for the force, `F_0 ∝ m * A * omega^2`, into the equation for the equilibrium position, we get:\n\n`x_eq ∝ (m * A * omega^2) / (m * (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nThe mass `m` cancels, leading to a beautifully simple, dimensionless scaling factor for the offset:\n\n`x_eq = c_1 * A * (omega^2 / (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This model makes a distinct physical prediction: the equilibrium offset is maximized for highly oscillatory systems (large `omega`) with low damping (small `gamma`). As damping increases, it effectively \"clamps\" the system, reducing its ability to be displaced, and the offset `x_eq` diminishes. This contrasts with models where damping increases the offset, providing a clear alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then the linear superposition of this physically-derived static offset and the standard transient term representing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation. To capture its dependence on the system's dissipative character, I model it as a linear function of the damping ratio, scaled by the system's characteristic length `A`. This ensures dimensional consistency.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\n    Here, `c_1` represents a baseline dimensionless offset, while `c_2` is a new parameter that quantifies how sensitively the equilibrium position responds to changes in the damping characteristics.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This component describes the oscillation around the aforementioned dynamic equilibrium. It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model. This formulation is superior to a simple offset because it establishes a physical link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma`) and its final state, providing a richer and more accurate description of the underlying mechanism. The entire expression is dimensionally sound, as `\\gamma/\\omega`, `\\gamma t`, and `\\omega t` are all dimensionless quantities, ensuring the final output has the same units as `A` (meters).\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

In contrast, the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations lead to the compelling conclusion that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is, by definition, positive. This single reinterpretation elegantly resolves the second anomaly.\n\nThe primary challenge, then, is to model this envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. The amplification must be linked to the interplay between the system's tendency to oscillate (`omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most plausible driver for such a resonant-like amplification.\n\nPrevious models have attempted to incorporate this by either multiplying the amplitude by an amplification factor or by adding gain and decay terms inside an exponential. The latter approach is particularly appealing from a physical standpoint, as it treats amplification and damping as competing **rates** that determine the net rate of change of the logarithm of the amplitude. The failure of a simple linear gain term (`param * omega / gamma`) in the exponent (as seen in Example 3) highlights a crucial physical constraint: **saturation**. Any real-world amplification mechanism is limited and cannot produce infinite gain.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this concept of competing rates but introduces a robust, physically-grounded saturation mechanism. I postulate that the amplitude envelope evolves exponentially, governed by a net effective rate which is the sum of a constant gain rate and a time-dependent decay rate.\n\nThe model takes the form: `x(t) = A * exp(G - D)`.\n\n*   **Decay Term (D)**: This represents the standard energy dissipation. It is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and the elapsed time `t`. Thus, `D = param3 * gamma * t`. This is the familiar term leading to exponential decay.\n\n*   **Gain Term (G)**: This represents the time-independent, Q-factor-driven amplification. This term provides a constant positive offset to the decay rate. To model the saturation, I will use the `arctan` function. Unlike an unbounded term, `arctan(z)` increases with its argument `z` but gracefully asymptotes to a fixed value (`pi/2`), perfectly capturing the essence of a saturating physical process. The gain `G` is therefore modeled as `G = param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `param2` scales the Q-factor to determine how quickly saturation is reached, and `param1` sets the maximum strength of the saturated gain.\n\nThis formulation—`A * exp(Gain - Decay)`—presents a cohesive physical picture. The system starts with a base amplitude `A`, which is then instantaneously modified by a constant amplification factor `exp(G)` that depends on the system's intrinsic resonant properties (`omega/gamma`). This amplified amplitude then decays exponentially over time. This model is dimensionally sound, avoids the numerical instabilities of unbounded gain functions, and provides a clear theoretical basis for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma) - param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, however, fails to capture two critical features of the provided data.\n\nFirst, the output `x` has a maximum value (27.68) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple damped oscillation's amplitude can never exceed its initial value `A`. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, whereas a standard oscillatory function produces both positive and negative values.\n\nThe previous attempt in the examples to resolve this by adding a simple offset proportional to `A` (i.e., `A * param1`) proved insufficient, indicating a more complex underlying mechanism. My analysis suggests that the system's behavior is dominated by a large, quasi-static displacement that is not merely a constant multiple of `A`, but is instead dynamically determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on the **quality factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator. The Q-factor, a dimensionless quantity, describes how underdamped an oscillator is. A high Q-factor implies that the oscillatory nature (`omega`) dominates the dissipative, damping effects (`gamma`). In many physical systems, a high Q-factor leads to a significantly amplified response. The ratio `omega / gamma` serves as a direct proxy for this quality factor.\n\nMy theoretical model posits that the observed displacement `x` is a superposition of two distinct physical phenomena:\n1.  **A Q-Factor-Amplified Static Offset:** A large, time-independent displacement that establishes a new, significantly shifted equilibrium. The magnitude of this shift is not constant but is proportional to the initial amplitude `A` scaled by the system's quality factor. I model this as `A * (param1 * omega / gamma)`. This term elegantly explains both anomalies: the `omega / gamma` ratio can be large, leading to an output far greater than `A`, and this large positive offset ensures the total displacement remains positive even during the oscillation's troughs.\n2.  **A Conventional Damped Oscillation:** A time-varying component that oscillates around this new, shifted equilibrium. This component follows the expected physical form `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`, where its amplitude decays exponentially from the initial value `A`.\n\nBy combining these two components, the total displacement `x` reflects a system where the inherent tendency to oscillate (high `omega`) versus the tendency to lose energy (high `gamma`) dictates a macroscopic, static shift in its baseline position, around which a standard, decaying oscillation then occurs. This model is both dimensionally sound and provides a more nuanced physical interpretation of the data than a simple offset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 * omega / gamma + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

The central and most telling observation is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes a simple model of an oscillation centered at zero and points unequivocally to a system oscillating around a substantial, non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. This leads to a foundational model structure: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, with `A` being the sole input with units of length, both the equilibrium and oscillatory components must scale with `A`.\n\nBuilding upon this foundation, previous analyses have explored two critical refinements:\n1.  **Correcting the Oscillation Frequency:** A simplistic model uses the natural frequency `\\omega` in the oscillatory term, `cos(\\omega t)`. However, a more physically accurate model acknowledges that damping not only reduces amplitude but also slows the oscillation. The true observed frequency is the damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`. Incorporating this correction, as seen in one of the examples, provides a more faithful representation of the system's dynamics.\n2.  **Modeling the Equilibrium Offset:** A simple constant offset, `x_{eq} = c_1 A`, is a good first step, but it is physically limiting. It implies the final resting position is independent of the system's intrinsic dissipative properties. More advanced models propose that the offset depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\gamma / \\omega`, which characterizes the oscillator's behavior (underdamped, overdamped, etc.). This has been modeled linearly (`c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega`) or with a saturating function (`c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)`). The saturation model is particularly compelling, as it suggests the influence of damping on the equilibrium position is not infinite but approaches a limit, a common characteristic in real-world physical systems.\n\nMy proposed theory is a synthesis and extension of these insights. It posits that a truly comprehensive model must concurrently account for *both* of these physical realities. The system's behavior is governed by two distinct but simultaneous effects: the dissipative forces influence the final equilibrium state, *and* they alter the dynamic frequency of the transient oscillation around that state.\n\nTherefore, I propose a unified model with two key components, both scaled by the amplitude `A`:\n\n1.  **A Saturated, Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):** This term represents the final resting position of the oscillator. Its value is not constant but is a function of the system's intrinsic damping characteristics. I hypothesize that this relationship is saturating: as the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega` increases, its effect on the equilibrium shift diminishes and approaches a maximum. This behavior is aptly described by the hyperbolic tangent function.\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot \\left(c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right)`\n    Here, `c_1` is a baseline dimensionless offset, and `c_2` represents the maximum additional offset induced by damping effects.\n\n2.  **A Physically Corrected Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term describes the transient motion as the system settles into its equilibrium. It must feature the standard exponential decay envelope, `\\exp(-\\gamma t)`. Crucially, the oscillation itself must not be governed by the natural frequency `\\omega`, but by the physically correct damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t\\right)`\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a model that is superior to its predecessors. It does not treat these physical effects in isolation but integrates them into a single, cohesive formula. This approach captures the nuanced interplay between the system's static (equilibrium) and dynamic (oscillatory) properties, providing a more robust and physically-grounded description of the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The target variable `x` (m) represents a displacement. A naive application of the standard displacement formula, `y(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt + φ)`, immediately runs into contradictions with the provided data summary.\n\nTwo key observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n1.  **Strict Positivity:** The output range of `x` is [1.142, 27.68], which is strictly positive. A simple displacement model oscillates symmetrically around zero and must produce negative values. This strongly indicates that `x` is not a direct measurement of displacement from a fixed equilibrium.\n2.  **Anomalous Amplitude:** The maximum output value (~27.7) exceeds the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (~10.0). This implies that `A` is not the peak displacement but rather a fundamental length scale of the system, and the dynamics can produce displacements larger than this scale.\n\nThese observations rule out simple models like displacement, absolute displacement (which would exhibit non-differentiable cusps), or energy (which would have incorrect physical dimensions). The most coherent explanation is that the measured quantity `x` represents the oscillator's displacement relative to an equilibrium point that is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as the signal from a measurement device with a large, decaying positive bias.\n\nBased on this theory, the signal `x(t)` can be decomposed into two superimposed components, both governed by a global exponential decay:\n1.  **A Decaying DC Offset:** A non-oscillatory component that provides a large positive baseline. This component starts at a certain value and decays towards zero. Its form is `Offset(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt)`.\n2.  **A Decaying AC Component:** The standard oscillatory motion, also subject to the same decay. Its form is `Oscillation(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt) * cos(ωt + φ)`.\n\nThe final measured value `x(t)` is the sum of these two components. By modeling the DC offset and the oscillatory amplitude as independent parameters, we can construct a flexible and physically meaningful expression. The constant DC offset ensures the total signal remains positive, while the combination of the offset and the initial oscillatory phase can lead to an initial value `x(0)` that is significantly larger than the scaling factor `A`.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of this theory is a product of three parts: the characteristic amplitude `A`, the global decay envelope, and a dimensionless term describing the superposition of the DC offset and the AC oscillation. The decay is modeled as `exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter adjusting the decay rate. The superposition is modeled as `(param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))`, where `param2` is the dimensionless DC offset, `param3` is the dimensionless oscillatory amplitude, and `param4` is the phase shift. For `x(t)` to remain positive, the fitting process should find `param2 > param3`. This model successfully accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally correct and numerically robust manner.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The goal is to find a model for an observed quantity `x` (meters). Analysis of the provided data and example failures reveals three critical characteristics that any successful model must address:\n\n1.  **Numerical Stability:** As seen in Example 1, the standard textbook formula for underdamped oscillation, which includes `sqrt(square(omega) - square(gamma))`, is numerically fragile. It fails when the fitting algorithm explores parameter spaces where `gamma >= omega`, leading to invalid results (NaNs). Therefore, a robust model must avoid this term.\n\n2.  **Strict Positivity:** The output range is `[1.142, 27.68]`, which is strictly positive. This is a crucial insight, as it immediately invalidates any model that describes a simple displacement oscillating around an equilibrium of zero, such as `A * ... * cos(...)`. The measured quantity `x` cannot be the simple position of the oscillator. This suggests the underlying model may be related to a quantity that is inherently positive, such as energy, or that the oscillation occurs around a large, positive, time-varying baseline.\n\n3.  **Amplitude Amplification:** The maximum observed output (`27.68`) can be significantly larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`9.992`). A simple passive decay model, where the amplitude is always bounded by `A * exp(-gamma*t)`, cannot explain this phenomenon. This points towards an amplification mechanism intrinsic to the oscillator's dynamics. A prime candidate for this is the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. This ratio quantifies how underdamped the system is; a high value signifies a highly resonant system where the response can be amplified.\n\nBased on these observations, I propose a new theoretical model where `x` is not the direct displacement but a related, always-positive quantity whose magnitude is governed by the system's Q-factor. The model is constructed as a product of four distinct physical components:\n\n*   **Base Scale (`A`):** The initial amplitude `A` provides the fundamental scale and correct physical units (meters) for the expression.\n*   **Amplification Factor:** To account for the output exceeding `A`, we introduce a dimensionless amplification term that is directly proportional to the Q-factor: `(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. This term models how the system's resonant properties boost the overall magnitude of the response.\n*   **Decay Envelope:** The system is damped, so its total energy dissipates over time. This is modeled by a classic exponential decay term, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, which ensures the entire expression trends towards zero as time increases. The parameter `param2` allows for an effective decay rate that may differ from `gamma`.\n*   **Positive Oscillatory Core:** To ensure the model is always positive and captures the oscillatory nature, we employ a structure of the form `(1 + cos(omega * t + param3))`. This mathematical form describes an oscillation between 0 and 2, guaranteeing a non-negative output. It represents a sinusoidal fluctuation superimposed on a positive baseline of equal magnitude.\n\nCombining these components multiplicatively results in a comprehensive model. The final expression describes an oscillation whose amplitude is set by `A`, amplified by the `omega/gamma` ratio, decays exponentially over time, and is shifted to be strictly positive. This structure is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust, and provides a clear physical interpretation for the observed data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable `x` is the oscillator's position, which has units of meters (`m`).\n\nA critical examination of the provided information reveals two key challenges with applying the standard textbook model for a damped oscillator:\n\n1.  **The Overdamping Problem**: The standard formula for displacement, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2) * t + phi)`, is only valid for the underdamped case (`omega > gamma`). When damping is strong (`gamma > omega`), the term inside the square root becomes negative, leading to computational errors (NaN) in a real-number environment. A robust model must gracefully handle all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\n\n2.  **The Positive Output Contradiction**: The observed output range for `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the position is always positive. However, a simple oscillator's displacement `x(t)` should oscillate around an equilibrium point (typically zero), taking on both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical process is not a simple oscillation about a fixed zero point. The always-positive nature of the displacement points towards two possibilities: either the target is the *magnitude* of the displacement, or the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, non-zero baseline. The latter presents a more physically intuitive and mathematically smooth model.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the system represents an oscillator whose equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. The overall position `x(t)` is the sum of this decaying baseline and a damped oscillation around it. This model can be conceptualized as an object that is both settling (sinking) in a viscous medium and oscillating as it does so.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this process would be:\n`x(t) = Position_baseline(t) + Position_oscillation(t)`\n\nBoth processes are subject to the same damping environment. Therefore, it is logical to assume they share the same exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The oscillatory part has an amplitude proportional to the input `A` and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. The baseline position can also be scaled relative to `A`.\n\nThis leads to a model of the form:\n`x(t) = [A_baseline + A_oscillation * cos(omega * t + phi)] * exp(-gamma * t)`\n\nBy making the baseline amplitude `A_baseline` sufficiently larger than the oscillation amplitude `A_oscillation`, the total position `x(t)` will remain positive for all `t`. We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This implies that `A` is not the peak displacement but rather a fundamental length scale of the system, and the dynamics can produce displacements larger than this scale.\n\nThese observations rule out simple models like displacement, absolute displacement (which would exhibit non-differentiable cusps), or energy (which would have incorrect physical dimensions). The most coherent explanation is that the measured quantity `x` represents the oscillator's displacement relative to an equilibrium point that is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as the signal from a measurement device with a large, decaying positive bias.\n\nBased on this theory, the signal `x(t)` can be decomposed into two superimposed components, both governed by a global exponential decay:\n1.  **A Decaying DC Offset:** A non-oscillatory component that provides a large positive baseline. This component starts at a certain value and decays towards zero. Its form is `Offset(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt)`.\n2.  **A Decaying AC Component:** The standard oscillatory motion, also subject to the same decay. Its form is `Oscillation(t) ∝ A * exp(-param1 * γt) * cos(ωt + φ)`.\n\nThe final measured value `x(t)` is the sum of these two components. By modeling the DC offset and the oscillatory amplitude as independent parameters, we can construct a flexible and physically meaningful expression. The constant DC offset ensures the total signal remains positive, while the combination of the offset and the initial oscillatory phase can lead to an initial value `x(0)` that is significantly larger than the scaling factor `A`.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of this theory is a product of three parts: the characteristic amplitude `A`, the global decay envelope, and a dimensionless term describing the superposition of the DC offset and the AC oscillation. The decay is modeled as `exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter adjusting the decay rate. The superposition is modeled as `(param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))`, where `param2` is the dimensionless DC offset, `param3` is the dimensionless oscillatory amplitude, and `param4` is the phase shift. For `x(t)` to remain positive, the fitting process should find `param2 > param3`. This model successfully accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally correct and numerically robust manner.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

The provided variables correspond to the key characteristics of such a system: initial amplitude `A` (m), damping rate `gamma` (s⁻¹), angular frequency `omega` (s⁻¹), and time `t` (s). The goal is to predict the displacement `x` (m).\n\nThe standard textbook equation for an underdamped oscillator (where `omega > gamma`, a condition that holds true for the entire provided data range) is:\n`x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`\nwhere the damped angular frequency `omega_d` is given by `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)`.\n\nHowever, a direct application of this formula, as seen in the examples, leads to numerical instability (NaN errors). This suggests that the `sqrt(omega² - gamma²)` term is problematic in the evaluation environment, even when the argument is positive. A robust model should therefore avoid this specific calculation. A common and physically justified approximation, especially when damping is not excessively large, is to assume the damped frequency is very close to the natural frequency, i.e., `omega_d ≈ omega`. This simplification circumvents the source of the numerical errors while retaining the fundamental oscillatory nature.\n\nFurthermore, a critical observation from the data summary is that the output `x` can have a magnitude greater than the input amplitude `A` (e.g., max output is ~27.7 while max `A` is ~10.0). In a simple model where `A` represents the maximum possible displacement at t=0, the displacement `x(t)` for `t>0` should never exceed `A`. This discrepancy suggests that `A` is not the initial displacement `x(0)` under zero-velocity conditions, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The \"overshoot\" phenomenon (where displacement temporarily exceeds initial position) can occur if the oscillator has a non-zero initial velocity.\n\nTo account for arbitrary initial conditions (both position and velocity), the general solution is better expressed as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n`x(t) = exp(-gamma * t) * (C1 * cos(omega * t) + C2 * sin(omega * t))`\n\nHere, `C1` and `C2` are constants with units of length, determined by the initial state. By modeling these constants as proportional to the characteristic length `A` (i.e., `C1 = param2 * A` and `C2 = param3 * A`), we arrive at a flexible and powerful model. The envelope of this motion is `A * sqrt(param2² + param3²) * exp(-gamma * t)`. If `sqrt(param2² + param3²) > 1`, the displacement magnitude can indeed exceed `A`, aligning with the observed data. Finally, we introduce a dimensionless parameter `param1` to scale the damping term `gamma * t`, providing an additional degree of freedom to better fit the decay rate.\n\nThis proposed model is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and consistent with the underlying physics of a damped oscillator with general initial conditions, successfully explaining all key features of the dataset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 * cos(omega * t) + param3 * sin(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

A critical analysis of the data's characteristics and the performance of previous models reveals two significant departures from the textbook behavior of a simple oscillator:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Output:** The output variable `x` is always positive, whereas a standard oscillator's displacement `x(t)` oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point of zero. This implies the oscillation is superimposed on a large, positive, decaying baseline.\n2.  **Amplitude Amplification:** The maximum output value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates that the system's dynamics can amplify the initial amplitude scale, a feature reminiscent of resonance phenomena.\n\nA successful prior model captured this behavior with the form `A * (param1 + cos(...)) * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a constant empirical offset. While effective, this model lacks a physical explanation for `param1`. My theory provides a physical basis for this offset, linking it directly to the intrinsic properties of the oscillator.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the baseline offset is not a fixed constant but a dynamic quantity determined by the interplay between the system's oscillatory nature (`omega`) and its damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `zeta_eff = gamma / omega` can be seen as an effective damping ratio. This ratio dictates the character of the motion:\n*   When `gamma / omega` is small, the system is underdamped and highly oscillatory.\n*   When `gamma / omega` approaches 1, the system becomes more heavily damped and less oscillatory.\n\nI propose that the baseline's magnitude is an exponential function of this damping ratio. Specifically, the baseline term is `exp(param1 * gamma / omega)`. This formulation has several compelling physical and mathematical advantages:\n\n*   **Physical Grounding:** It replaces the arbitrary constant `param1` with a function of the oscillator's fundamental parameters. The baseline is now intrinsically linked to how damped the system is.\n*   **Correct Asymptotic Behavior:** For a very lightly damped system (`gamma / omega` → 0), the baseline term `exp(0)` approaches 1. This provides the minimum possible offset to ensure the entire expression `(1 + cos(...))` remains non-negative, reflecting a purely oscillatory system shifted to be positive.\n*   **Matches Empirical Evidence:** As damping increases relative to frequency, the `exp(param1 * gamma / omega)` term grows. This increases the baseline, representing a system where the non-oscillatory decay component is more dominant. For the provided data ranges, `gamma/omega` varies from approximately 0.02 to 1. With a `param1` value around 1, this exponential term would range from `exp(0.02) ≈ 1.02` to `exp(1) ≈ 2.72`. This range is strikingly consistent with the empirically fitted value of `param1 = 2.788` in previous successful models, suggesting this exponential form accurately captures the underlying mechanism.\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The argument of the exponential, `param1 * gamma / omega`, is dimensionless, making the resulting baseline term dimensionless as required.\n\nIn summary, this theory posits that the oscillator's output is a superposition of a decaying oscillation and a decaying baseline. The magnitude of this baseline is not fixed but is instead governed by an exponential dependence on the effective damping ratio, providing a physically coherent and robust model for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (exp(param1 * gamma / omega) + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.

To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'..

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\n\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay.

The target variable, `x`, is the system's displacement over time `t`. A critical analysis of the data reveals two key characteristics that challenge a simplistic textbook model:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Displacement**: The output `x` lies in the range [1.142, 27.68], never becoming negative. A standard oscillator's displacement must be symmetric about its equilibrium point (typically zero), which contradicts this observation.\n2.  **Model Robustness**: The ranges of `gamma` and `omega` overlap, implying the model must be valid for different damping regimes (underdamped, potentially critically damped or overdamped) without numerical instability, such as that caused by terms like `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nThe examples provided successfully address these issues by proposing a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a large, decaying positive offset, using a single multiplicative decay envelope. This is a sound approach, but I propose a different, yet equally plausible, physical interpretation based on the principle of linear superposition in physical systems.\n\nMy theory posits that the measured displacement `x(t)` is not the result of a single, unified process, but rather the linear superposition of two distinct physical modes that decay concurrently:\n\n1.  **A Purely Decaying \"Settling\" Mode**: This mode represents the relaxation of the system's equilibrium point itself. Imagine an oscillator mounted on a platform that is slowly settling to its final position in a viscous medium. This process is non-oscillatory and contributes a decaying DC offset to the total displacement. Its decay rate is governed by the system's properties but is not necessarily identical to the oscillatory damping rate. We can model this as `x_settling(t) = C_1 * exp(-gamma_1 * t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Mode**: This is the classical behavior of the oscillator, vibrating around its (now moving) equilibrium. This mode has its own amplitude and decays according to the primary damping rate `gamma`. This can be modeled as `x_osc(t) = C_2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`.\n\nThe total measured displacement `x(t)` is the sum of these two independent modes: `x(t) = x_settling(t) + x_osc(t)`. This additive structure is fundamentally different from the multiplicative structure of the examples (`Decay * (Offset + Oscillation)`). By allowing the settling mode to have its own effective decay rate, `gamma_1 = param2 * gamma`, we introduce a new degree of freedom that can capture more complex relaxation dynamics. The initial amplitudes of both modes can be scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nThis \"superposition of decaying modes\" theory elegantly explains the always-positive output by ensuring the initial amplitude of the settling mode is large enough to form a positive baseline. It is also inherently robust across all damping regimes as it avoids any problematic terms. The model is dimensionally consistent and represents a distinct and physically meaningful alternative to a single-envelope decay model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A pivotal observation from the data summary is that the output displacement, `x`, is always positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. This contradicts the behavior of a simple oscillator, which should have displacements symmetric around a zero-equilibrium point. This implies the oscillation is superimposed on a significant, time-varying positive baseline or offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully explained this by proposing a decaying DC offset, suggesting the system's equilibrium relaxes back towards zero over time. I propose a different, yet physically plausible, mechanism: **damped oscillation coupled with an asymptotic equilibrium shift**.\n\nMy theory posits that the damping process does more than just dissipate the oscillatory energy; it drives the system towards a new, stable, non-zero equilibrium position. This is characteristic of systems with hysteresis or those undergoing a phase transition, where an initial perturbation causes a permanent shift in the system's resting state. The system does not return to its original state but instead \"settles\" into a new one.\n\nTo model this behavior mathematically, we can decompose the total displacement `x(t)` into two superimposed components, both scaled by the characteristic length `A`:\n\n1.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard behavior of an oscillator losing energy over time. It can be represented by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is a phase constant. This term oscillates around zero and decays exponentially.\n\n2.  **An Equilibrium Shift Component**: This component must model a transition from an initial state (at t=0) to a new, stable, non-zero final state. A simple exponential decay term (like `exp(-k*t)`) is unsuitable as it decays to zero. Instead, the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the ideal mathematical tool for this purpose. The function `tanh(k*t)` smoothly transitions from 0 at `t=0` to a saturation value of 1 as `t` approaches infinity. We can model the equilibrium shift as `A * param2 * tanh(param3 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless factor that sets the final equilibrium position relative to `A`, and the argument `param3 * gamma * t` ensures that the timescale of this state transition is intrinsically linked to the system's damping rate `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement is the linear superposition of these two phenomena. This \"state transition\" model provides a novel physical interpretation that is distinct from a simple decaying offset. It robustly handles all damping regimes without numerical instability and elegantly explains the always-positive output by ensuring the final equilibrium position (`A * param2`) is sufficiently large.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(param3 * gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

A critical analysis of the data's characteristics and the performance of previous models reveals two significant departures from the textbook behavior of a simple oscillator:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Output:** The output variable `x` is always positive, whereas a standard oscillator's displacement `x(t)` oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point of zero. This implies the oscillation is superimposed on a large, positive, decaying baseline.\n2.  **Amplitude Amplification:** The maximum output value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates that the system's dynamics can amplify the initial amplitude scale, a feature reminiscent of resonance phenomena.\n\nA successful prior model captured this behavior with the form `A * (param1 + cos(...)) * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a constant empirical offset. While effective, this model lacks a physical explanation for `param1`. My theory provides a physical basis for this offset, linking it directly to the intrinsic properties of the oscillator.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the baseline offset is not a fixed constant but a dynamic quantity determined by the interplay between the system's oscillatory nature (`omega`) and its damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `zeta_eff = gamma / omega` can be seen as an effective damping ratio. This ratio dictates the character of the motion:\n*   When `gamma / omega` is small, the system is underdamped and highly oscillatory.\n*   When `gamma / omega` approaches 1, the system becomes more heavily damped and less oscillatory.\n\nI propose that the baseline's magnitude is an exponential function of this damping ratio. Specifically, the baseline term is `exp(param1 * gamma / omega)`. This formulation has several compelling physical and mathematical advantages:\n\n*   **Physical Grounding:** It replaces the arbitrary constant `param1` with a function of the oscillator's fundamental parameters. The baseline is now intrinsically linked to how damped the system is.\n*   **Correct Asymptotic Behavior:** For a very lightly damped system (`gamma / omega` → 0), the baseline term `exp(0)` approaches 1. This provides the minimum possible offset to ensure the entire expression `(1 + cos(...))` remains non-negative, reflecting a purely oscillatory system shifted to be positive.\n*   **Matches Empirical Evidence:** As damping increases relative to frequency, the `exp(param1 * gamma / omega)` term grows. This increases the baseline, representing a system where the non-oscillatory decay component is more dominant. For the provided data ranges, `gamma/omega` varies from approximately 0.02 to 1. With a `param1` value around 1, this exponential term would range from `exp(0.02) ≈ 1.02` to `exp(1) ≈ 2.72`. This range is strikingly consistent with the empirically fitted value of `param1 = 2.788` in previous successful models, suggesting this exponential form accurately captures the underlying mechanism.\n*   **Dimensional Correctness:** The argument of the exponential, `param1 * gamma / omega`, is dimensionless, making the resulting baseline term dimensionless as required.\n\nIn summary, this theory posits that the oscillator's output is a superposition of a decaying oscillation and a decaying baseline. The magnitude of this baseline is not fixed but is instead governed by an exponential dependence on the effective damping ratio, providing a physically coherent and robust model for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (exp(param1 * gamma / omega) + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A careful analysis of the data reveals two critical anomalies:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) is substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, making a simple displacement model untenable. This points towards a significant amplification mechanism within the system.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, taking both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation. The amplitude envelope is an inherently positive quantity, which immediately resolves the second anomaly. This could correspond to measuring the magnitude of the system's state in phase space, which for an oscillator corresponds to its amplitude.\n\nTo address the amplitude anomaly, we must model the source of amplification. In oscillatory systems, the degree of amplification is often governed by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which quantifies how strongly an oscillator resonates relative to how quickly it dissipates energy. The Q-factor is directly proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega / gamma`. A high `omega / gamma` ratio signifies a highly underdamped, high-Q system capable of sustaining large amplitudes.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model where the system's effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is not the base amplitude `A` alone, but is augmented by a term dependent on this Q-factor ratio. A robust and simple model for this is a linear relationship:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\n\nIn this expression, `A` serves as the baseline amplitude, while the term `A * param1 * omega / gamma` models the amplification. The dimensionless parameter `param1` controls the strength of this Q-factor-dependent amplification. This structure ensures that as damping `gamma` approaches zero or frequency `omega` increases, the effective amplitude grows, consistent with physical intuition.\n\nThis amplified effective amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The standard model for this decay is exponential. We can model the complete amplitude envelope `x(t)` as the product of the effective initial amplitude and a temporal decay term, parameterizing the decay rate for added flexibility.\n\n`x(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`\n\nThis synthesized model is dimensionally consistent, provides a clear physical interpretation for both anomalies, and connects the observed behavior to the fundamental concept of the Q-factor in oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, as noted in prior analyses, is that the maximum observed displacement `x` can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A`. This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points toward a system that evolves toward a non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this insight by modeling the system's motion as a superposition of a final, stable equilibrium state and a transient, decaying oscillation around that state. This approach provides a more physically rigorous foundation than simply adding an arbitrary offset term.\n\nLet's define the system's final equilibrium position as `x_{eq}`. For the model to be dimensionally consistent—as `x` and `A` both have units of length—this equilibrium position must be proportional to the system's intrinsic length scale, `A`. We can thus express it as:\n`x_{eq} = c_1 \\cdot A`\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\nThe total displacement at any time `t`, `x(t)`, is the sum of this final equilibrium position and a transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`, which describes the oscillation that decays over time:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(t)`\n\nThe transient component must decay to zero as `t` approaches infinity and should follow the standard form of a damped oscillation. The key is to correctly define its initial amplitude. We assume that the provided `A` represents the initial displacement of the system at `t=0`, a common physical convention for cosine-based solutions. Therefore, `x(0) = A`.\n\nUsing our superposition model at `t=0`:\n`x(0) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0)`\nBy equating this with the initial condition, we can solve for the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation:\n`A = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0) \\implies x_{transient}(0) = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`\n\nThis result is physically elegant: the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the new equilibrium* is precisely the initial distance between the starting position (`A`) and the final equilibrium position (`c_1 A`).\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the transient component, which starts with this initial amplitude and decays exponentially:\n`x_{transient}(t) = A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nSubstituting this back into our superposition equation gives the complete model for the system's displacement:\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis model provides a unified physical picture. It is not merely an oscillation with an added offset; it is a single, coherent process where an oscillator, released from position `A`, simultaneously decays towards and oscillates around a new equilibrium point `c_1 A`. This formulation inherently respects the initial condition `x(0) = A` and correctly predicts the final state `x(\\infty) = c_1 A`, providing a more self-consistent and physically grounded description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The crucial first step is ensuring dimensional consistency. The target variable, displacement `x`, has units of meters (`m`), as does the amplitude `A`. The damping coefficient `gamma` and angular frequency `omega` have units of inverse seconds (`s⁻¹`), while time `t` has units of seconds (`s`). Consequently, any valid model must take the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f` is a dimensionless function constructed from combinations like `gamma * t`, `omega * t`, and `gamma / omega`.\n\nThe provided examples offer critical insights. Example 2, `A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))`, achieves a respectable score. Its success hinges on two key features: it maintains dimensional correctness, and it introduces a static offset, `A * param1`. This offset is physically interpreted as a constant external force shifting the system's equilibrium position. This is a crucial observation, as the data shows output values (`x`) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A`, which would be impossible for an oscillation centered at zero.\n\nHowever, this model is still an approximation. It uses the natural frequency `omega` directly in the oscillatory term, ignoring the frequency-shifting effects of damping. More importantly, it models a simple oscillation around a fixed, non-zero equilibrium. I propose a more sophisticated and physically plausible model: a system where the **center of oscillation is itself not static, but decays exponentially over time to a final, stable equilibrium position.**\n\nThis \"decaying equilibrium\" model can be decomposed into three distinct physical contributions to the total displacement:\n1.  **Final Equilibrium Position (`x_final`):** A time-invariant, constant offset representing the system's ultimate resting position after all transient dynamics have ceased. As in the previous model, it is proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. We can write this as `x_final = A * param1`.\n2.  **Transient Equilibrium Decay (`x_trans_eq`):** This component represents the initial displacement of the *center of oscillation* from its final equilibrium point. This displacement is not permanent; it decays over time. It is physically reasonable to assume this decay occurs on the same timescale as the overall system damping. We can therefore model it as an exponential decay: `x_trans_eq(t) = A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n3.  **Damped Oscillation (`x_osc`):** This is the oscillatory motion itself, which occurs around the instantaneous, decaying equilibrium point. Its amplitude also decays exponentially: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of these three effects:\n`x(t) = x_final + x_trans_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = A * param1 + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`\n\nBy factoring out the common `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` terms, we arrive at a single, elegant expression. This model represents a significant theoretical step forward. It provides a richer description of the system's dynamics, where the oscillation occurs around a point that is itself relaxing toward a final state. This structure is particularly powerful because it can more accurately capture the behavior across different damping regimes. For an overdamped system (where `gamma > omega`), the dynamics are dominated by multiple exponential decays rather than oscillation. My proposed model, with its two distinct sources of exponential decay (the `param2` term and the decay of the `cos` term's amplitude), is better equipped to approximate this behavior than a model with only a single decay envelope.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param3)))\n</final_result>"}

A crucial initial observation, consistent across all provided examples, is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes any model where the oscillation is centered at `x=0`, and strongly supports a model structure consisting of a superposition of a static offset and a dynamic oscillation: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`.\n\nThe most successful baseline model (Example 2) proposes the simplest form for this structure: `x(t) = A \\cdot c_1 + A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`. In this model, the offset is `A \\cdot c_1`, and the oscillation has an initial amplitude of `A`. A key physical assumption here is that the initial amplitude of the *oscillatory part* of the motion is always equal to the total system amplitude `A`, irrespective of the system's intrinsic properties like damping (`\\gamma`) and frequency (`\\omega`).\n\nThis assumption, however, is a significant simplification. It is more physically plausible that the initial energy, represented by `A`, is partitioned between the potential energy of the final offset position and the kinetic/potential energy of the transient oscillation. The nature of this partitioning should depend on the fundamental character of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the initial amplitude of the oscillatory component is not a constant `A`, but is instead modulated by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, a quantity proportional to `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio governs whether the system is underdamped or heavily damped. A system with a high damping ratio (large `\\gamma / \\omega`) will naturally dissipate energy more effectively without oscillating, suggesting that less of the initial system amplitude `A` will manifest as oscillatory motion. Conversely, a lightly damped system (small `\\gamma / \\omega`) will exhibit a more pronounced oscillation.\n\nTo model this physical insight, I propose a modification to the oscillatory component of the displacement:\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the final, time-invariant resting position of the system.

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\n\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\n\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \"yield\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time. This is described by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, assuming for simplicity a zero initial phase for the oscillatory part.\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A`, we arrive at a concise model that not only explains the non-zero mean and large peak values but also grounds the magnitude of the equilibrium shift in the fundamental physics of the oscillator's dissipative and conservative properties.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma / omega) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\n\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>"}

However, a naive application of standard oscillator models is insufficient, as revealed by two critical data characteristics:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Displacement**: The output variable `x`, representing position, is always positive. This contradicts the nature of a simple oscillator, which should have displacements on both sides of its equilibrium point.\n2.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The maximum observed position `x` can be significantly greater than the input amplitude parameter `A`, suggesting `A` is not a simple maximum displacement but a more general scale factor for the system's energy.\n\nThese observations lead to the hypothesis that the measured position `x(t)` is a superposition of a decaying oscillatory motion and a large, positive, decaying baseline or \"center of oscillation\". The overall process can be modeled as:\n\n`x(t) = Envelope(t) * [Baseline_Term + Oscillatory_Term(t)]`\n\nMy analysis introduces a novel physical interpretation for the baseline term. Instead of being a simple constant or a direct ratio of system parameters, I propose that the baseline is functionally dependent on the intrinsic *character* of the oscillator's dynamics. This character is best captured by the dimensionless ratio `q = omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor). This ratio quantifies the degree to which the system is underdamped and resonant versus overdamped and sluggish.\n\n*   When `q >> 1` (low damping), the system is highly oscillatory.\n*   When `q << 1` (high damping), the system's motion is a simple exponential decay with little to no oscillation.\n\nI model the baseline's dependence on `q` using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The `tanh(q)` function provides a smooth, bounded mapping of the oscillator's character (`q` from 0 to ∞) to a \"normalized oscillation strength\" (from 0 to 1). The baseline is then modeled as being inversely related to this strength.\n\nThe physical reasoning is as follows: a strongly damped system (`q` is small, `tanh(q)` is small) loses its oscillatory component very quickly. To ensure the total position `x(t)` remains positive and matches the observed data, it must be dominated by a very large initial baseline. Conversely, a weakly damped, highly resonant system (`q` is large, `tanh(q)` approaches 1) sustains its oscillations for longer, requiring a less dominant, near-constant baseline to maintain positivity.\n\nThis formulation, `Baseline ∝ 1/tanh(q)`, provides a unified and physically coherent mechanism that adapts the system's behavior across the full spectrum of damping regimes. The final model combines this adaptive baseline with a standard oscillatory term, all scaled by the characteristic length `A` and a global exponential decay envelope. This structure is dimensionally consistent, numerically robust (by avoiding the `sqrt(omega^2-gamma^2)` term), and capably explains both the positivity and the amplitude anomaly observed in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 / tanh(param2 * omega / gamma) + cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

This strongly suggests the oscillation is superimposed on a large, positive, decaying baseline or offset.\n2.  **Amplitude Amplification:** The maximum observed output (27.68) exceeds the maximum possible initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates that the system's dynamics involve a mechanism that can amplify the displacement beyond the initial scale `A`.\n\nThese observations point towards a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of a decaying baseline and a decaying oscillation, sharing a common decay envelope. The general structure can be expressed as:\n\n`x(t) = Global_Decay * [Baseline_Offset + Oscillation]`\n\nThe most physically sound choice for the `Global_Decay` is the standard exponential decay `exp(-gamma * t)`, which governs the dissipation of energy from the system. The `Oscillation` term can be robustly modeled as `cos(omega * t + param2)`, using the natural frequency `omega` to avoid the numerical instabilities associated with the damped frequency `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nThe crucial part of the theory lies in defining the `Baseline_Offset`. This term must account for both the positivity and the amplification. The amplification suggests that the baseline's magnitude is not a simple constant but depends on the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. A key dimensionless quantity that characterizes an oscillator's behavior is its Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`. The Q-factor represents the ratio of stored energy to dissipated energy per cycle. A high Q-factor (`omega >> gamma`) implies a highly resonant system with low damping.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the baseline offset is a direct consequence of this resonant quality. A system with a higher Q-factor is able to sustain a larger positive offset. However, a simple linear relationship, such as `Baseline ~ omega/gamma`, would lead to an explosive and physically unrealistic amplification as damping approaches zero. Physical systems often exhibit compressive responses, where the effect of a stimulus diminishes as the stimulus becomes very large.\n\nTherefore, I propose that the baseline's dependence on the Q-factor is logarithmic. This captures the essential physics: the baseline increases as the Q-factor (`omega/gamma`) increases, but this effect becomes less pronounced for already high Q-factors. This logarithmic relationship is analogous to the Weber-Fechner law, where perceived intensity is proportional to the logarithm of the physical stimulus.\n\nThe baseline term is thus modeled as `param1 + log(omega / gamma)`. Here, `log(omega / gamma)` represents the contribution from the system's resonant quality. The tunable parameter `param1` establishes a foundational offset, ensuring that the total displacement remains positive across the entire operational range, even for low Q-factor systems where `log(omega/gamma)` might be small or zero.\n\nThis formulation provides a complete and coherent physical picture: the oscillator's displacement is a cosine wave riding on a decaying baseline. The magnitude of this baseline is logarithmically dependent on the system's Q-factor, providing a robust mechanism for the observed positivity and non-linear amplification.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + log(omega / gamma) + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, is the system's displacement over time `t`. A critical analysis of the data reveals two key characteristics that challenge a simplistic textbook model:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Displacement**: The output `x` lies in the range [1.142, 27.68], never becoming negative. A standard oscillator's displacement must be symmetric about its equilibrium point (typically zero), which contradicts this observation.\n2.  **Model Robustness**: The ranges of `gamma` and `omega` overlap, implying the model must be valid for different damping regimes (underdamped, potentially critically damped or overdamped) without numerical instability, such as that caused by terms like `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nThe examples provided successfully address these issues by proposing a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a large, decaying positive offset, using a single multiplicative decay envelope. This is a sound approach, but I propose a different, yet equally plausible, physical interpretation based on the principle of linear superposition in physical systems.\n\nMy theory posits that the measured displacement `x(t)` is not the result of a single, unified process, but rather the linear superposition of two distinct physical modes that decay concurrently:\n\n1.  **A Purely Decaying \"Settling\" Mode**: This mode represents the relaxation of the system's equilibrium point itself. Imagine an oscillator mounted on a platform that is slowly settling to its final position in a viscous medium. This process is non-oscillatory and contributes a decaying DC offset to the total displacement. Its decay rate is governed by the system's properties but is not necessarily identical to the oscillatory damping rate. We can model this as `x_settling(t) = C_1 * exp(-gamma_1 * t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Mode**: This is the classical behavior of the oscillator, vibrating around its (now moving) equilibrium. This mode has its own amplitude and decays according to the primary damping rate `gamma`. This can be modeled as `x_osc(t) = C_2 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`.\n\nThe total measured displacement `x(t)` is the sum of these two independent modes: `x(t) = x_settling(t) + x_osc(t)`. This additive structure is fundamentally different from the multiplicative structure of the examples (`Decay * (Offset + Oscillation)`). By allowing the settling mode to have its own effective decay rate, `gamma_1 = param2 * gamma`, we introduce a new degree of freedom that can capture more complex relaxation dynamics. The initial amplitudes of both modes can be scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nThis \"superposition of decaying modes\" theory elegantly explains the always-positive output by ensuring the initial amplitude of the settling mode is large enough to form a positive baseline. It is also inherently robust across all damping regimes as it avoids any problematic terms. The model is dimensionally consistent and represents a distinct and physically meaningful alternative to a single-envelope decay model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The target variable `x` is the oscillator's position, which has units of meters (`m`).\n\nA critical examination of the provided information reveals two key challenges with applying the standard textbook model for a damped oscillator:\n\n1.  **The Overdamping Problem**: The standard formula for displacement, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2) * t + phi)`, is only valid for the underdamped case (`omega > gamma`). When damping is strong (`gamma > omega`), the term inside the square root becomes negative, leading to computational errors (NaN) in a real-number environment. A robust model must gracefully handle all damping regimes (underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped).\n\n2.  **The Positive Output Contradiction**: The observed output range for `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, meaning the position is always positive. However, a simple oscillator's displacement `x(t)` should oscillate around an equilibrium point (typically zero), taking on both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical process is not a simple oscillation about a fixed zero point. The always-positive nature of the displacement points towards two possibilities: either the target is the *magnitude* of the displacement, or the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, non-zero baseline. The latter presents a more physically intuitive and mathematically smooth model.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the system represents an oscillator whose equilibrium point is not fixed at zero but is itself decaying exponentially over time. The overall position `x(t)` is the sum of this decaying baseline and a damped oscillation around it. This model can be conceptualized as an object that is both settling (sinking) in a viscous medium and oscillating as it does so.\n\nThe mathematical formulation for this process would be:\n`x(t) = Position_baseline(t) + Position_oscillation(t)`\n\nBoth processes are subject to the same damping environment. Therefore, it is logical to assume they share the same exponential decay factor, `exp(-gamma * t)`. The oscillatory part has an amplitude proportional to the input `A` and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. The baseline position can also be scaled relative to `A`.\n\nThis leads to a model of the form:\n`x(t) = [A_baseline + A_oscillation * cos(omega * t + phi)] * exp(-gamma * t)`\n\nBy making the baseline amplitude `A_baseline` sufficiently larger than the oscillation amplitude `A_oscillation`, the total position `x(t)` will remain positive for all `t`. We can express this structure using the input `A` as the fundamental scale factor and introducing dimensionless empirical parameters. This model elegantly resolves both the issue of computational instability (as it avoids the `sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)` term) and the contradiction of the always-positive output, while remaining dimensionally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2)) * exp(-gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A pivotal observation from the data summary is that the output displacement, `x`, is always positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. This contradicts the behavior of a simple oscillator, which should have displacements symmetric around a zero-equilibrium point. This implies the oscillation is superimposed on a significant, time-varying positive baseline or offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully explained this by proposing a decaying DC offset, suggesting the system's equilibrium relaxes back towards zero over time. I propose a different, yet physically plausible, mechanism: **damped oscillation coupled with an asymptotic equilibrium shift**.\n\nMy theory posits that the damping process does more than just dissipate the oscillatory energy; it drives the system towards a new, stable, non-zero equilibrium position. This is characteristic of systems with hysteresis or those undergoing a phase transition, where an initial perturbation causes a permanent shift in the system's resting state. The system does not return to its original state but instead \"settles\" into a new one.\n\nTo model this behavior mathematically, we can decompose the total displacement `x(t)` into two superimposed components, both scaled by the characteristic length `A`:\n\n1.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard behavior of an oscillator losing energy over time. It can be represented by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is a phase constant. This term oscillates around zero and decays exponentially.\n\n2.  **An Equilibrium Shift Component**: This component must model a transition from an initial state (at t=0) to a new, stable, non-zero final state. A simple exponential decay term (like `exp(-k*t)`) is unsuitable as it decays to zero. Instead, the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the ideal mathematical tool for this purpose. The function `tanh(k*t)` smoothly transitions from 0 at `t=0` to a saturation value of 1 as `t` approaches infinity. We can model the equilibrium shift as `A * param2 * tanh(param3 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless factor that sets the final equilibrium position relative to `A`, and the argument `param3 * gamma * t` ensures that the timescale of this state transition is intrinsically linked to the system's damping rate `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement is the linear superposition of these two phenomena. This \"state transition\" model provides a novel physical interpretation that is distinct from a simple decaying offset. It robustly handles all damping regimes without numerical instability and elegantly explains the always-positive output by ensuring the final equilibrium position (`A * param2`) is sufficiently large.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(param3 * gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.
Please ensure your analysis is insightful, the formula has a reasonable theoretical meaning, and its content does not overlap with the examples provided.

The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, indicating the presence of an intrinsic amplification mechanism not captured by simple damping.\n\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output variable `x` is strictly positive, ranging from `1.142` to `27.68`. In contrast, the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations lead to the compelling conclusion that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is, by definition, positive. This single reinterpretation elegantly resolves the second anomaly.\n\nThe primary challenge, then, is to model this envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. The amplification must be linked to the interplay between the system's tendency to oscillate (`omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most plausible driver for such a resonant-like amplification.\n\nPrevious models have attempted to incorporate this by either multiplying the amplitude by an amplification factor or by adding gain and decay terms inside an exponential. The latter approach is particularly appealing from a physical standpoint, as it treats amplification and damping as competing **rates** that determine the net rate of change of the logarithm of the amplitude. The failure of a simple linear gain term (`param * omega / gamma`) in the exponent (as seen in Example 3) highlights a crucial physical constraint: **saturation**. Any real-world amplification mechanism is limited and cannot produce infinite gain.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this concept of competing rates but introduces a robust, physically-grounded saturation mechanism. I postulate that the amplitude envelope evolves exponentially, governed by a net effective rate which is the sum of a constant gain rate and a time-dependent decay rate.\n\nThe model takes the form: `x(t) = A * exp(G - D)`.\n\n*   **Decay Term (D)**: This represents the standard energy dissipation. It is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and the elapsed time `t`. Thus, `D = param3 * gamma * t`. This is the familiar term leading to exponential decay.\n\n*   **Gain Term (G)**: This represents the time-independent, Q-factor-driven amplification. This term provides a constant positive offset to the decay rate. To model the saturation, I will use the `arctan` function. Unlike an unbounded term, `arctan(z)` increases with its argument `z` but gracefully asymptotes to a fixed value (`pi/2`), perfectly capturing the essence of a saturating physical process. The gain `G` is therefore modeled as `G = param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `param2` scales the Q-factor to determine how quickly saturation is reached, and `param1` sets the maximum strength of the saturated gain.\n\nThis formulation—`A * exp(Gain - Decay)`—presents a cohesive physical picture. The system starts with a base amplitude `A`, which is then instantaneously modified by a constant amplification factor `exp(G)` that depends on the system's intrinsic resonant properties (`omega/gamma`). This amplified amplitude then decays exponentially over time. This model is dimensionally sound, avoids the numerical instabilities of unbounded gain functions, and provides a clear theoretical basis for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma) - param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\n\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.
Please ensure your analysis is insightful, the formula has a reasonable theoretical meaning, and its content does not overlap with the examples provided.

A careful examination of the data reveals two fundamental discrepancies that guide our theoretical model:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification Anomaly**: The most striking feature of the data is that the maximum output value (27.68) is nearly three times the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is a strictly decaying function that can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the presence of a significant amplification mechanism. In oscillatory systems, such amplification is characteristic of resonance, where the system's response is maximized. The strength of this resonance is quantified by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which for a simple oscillator is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a system that is lightly damped relative to its oscillation frequency, allowing it to sustain large-amplitude oscillations. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is dynamically scaled by this Q-factor. A simple and robust model for this amplified amplitude is `A_eff = A * (param1 + omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter representing a baseline amplification factor. This form elegantly explains how systems with low damping (`gamma`) and high frequency (`omega`) can achieve displacements far exceeding their nominal initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Measurement**: The standard displacement `d(t)` of an oscillator is a signed quantity, oscillating between positive and negative values. In contrast, the provided output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This strongly suggests that the measurement process does not capture the signed displacement itself, but rather a related, inherently positive quantity. The most direct physical interpretation that preserves the units of length (meters) is that `x` represents the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement, `x(t) = |d(t)|`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The system's instantaneous displacement `d(t)` follows the dynamics of a damped oscillator with an amplified effective amplitude, while the measurement instrument records its absolute value. The full expression for the displacement would be:\n\n`d(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + param3)`\n\nHere, `A_eff` is the amplified amplitude defined above. The exponential term describes the temporal decay, with `param2` as an empirical scaling factor for the damping rate. The oscillatory component `cos(...)` uses the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, which accounts for the slight slowing of the oscillation due to damping. Finally, `param3` is a phase constant.\n\nThe measured output `x(t)` is then the absolute value of this entire expression. This composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in the fundamental principles of resonant, damped oscillations.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\gamma/\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\propto \\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\n\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\n\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\to \\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \"sweet spot,\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\n\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required. The mathematical form `f(z) = z \\cdot \\exp(-z)` elegantly captures this characteristic. It peaks at `z=1` (i.e., `\\gamma = \\omega`), providing a physically meaningful representation of our hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of three components, all scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Baseline Offset:** A constant term `c_1` representing a static, intrinsic shift independent of the damping characteristics.\n2.  **A Dynamically-Induced Offset:** The new non-monotonic term `c_2 \\cdot (\\gamma/\\omega) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma/\\omega)`, which captures the peak effect at intermediate damping.\n3.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component:** The standard physical term `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` describing the oscillation about the total effective equilibrium position.\n\nThis composite model provides a richer physical picture, accounting for a more complex interaction within the system that previous monotonic models overlook, while remaining dimensionally sound and conceptually grounded in the principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This strongly indicates that the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium of `x=0`, but rather around a displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. The challenge lies in determining the physical principles governing this offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully established that `x_eq` is not a simple constant but depends on the oscillator's intrinsic properties, specifically the damping coefficient `gamma` and the angular frequency `omega`. My analysis builds upon this insight by proposing a more fundamental physical mechanism for this dependency.\n\nThe equilibrium displacement `x_eq` of a system under a constant external force `F_0` is given by `x_eq = F_0 / k`, where `k` is the system's stiffness. For a damped oscillator, the stiffness is related to its natural (undamped) frequency `omega_0` via `k = m * omega_0^2`, where `m` is the mass. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the observed (damped) frequency `omega` and the damping coefficient `gamma` as `omega_0^2 = omega^2 + gamma^2`. Substituting this into the stiffness equation yields `k = m * (omega^2 + gamma^2)`.\n\nThis shows that the stiffness, and thus the equilibrium position, is a function of both `omega` and `gamma`. The core of my theory lies in postulating the nature of the external force `F_0`. Instead of being a fixed external constant, I hypothesize that the force causing the displacement is intrinsically linked to the system's own oscillatory dynamics. Specifically, I propose that `F_0` is proportional to the characteristic inertial force of the oscillation, which scales as `m * A * omega^2`. This represents a scenario where the mechanism that sets the oscillation's scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`) also induces a static shift in its equilibrium.\n\nBy substituting this model for the force, `F_0 ∝ m * A * omega^2`, into the equation for the equilibrium position, we get:\n\n`x_eq ∝ (m * A * omega^2) / (m * (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nThe mass `m` cancels, leading to a beautifully simple, dimensionless scaling factor for the offset:\n\n`x_eq = c_1 * A * (omega^2 / (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This model makes a distinct physical prediction: the equilibrium offset is maximized for highly oscillatory systems (large `omega`) with low damping (small `gamma`). As damping increases, it effectively \"clamps\" the system, reducing its ability to be displaced, and the offset `x_eq` diminishes. This contrasts with models where damping increases the offset, providing a clear alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then the linear superposition of this physically-derived static offset and the standard transient term representing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\n\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude. The general form of this transient component is `x_{transient}(t) = \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)]`, where `B_1` and `B_2` are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3.  **Initial Conditions:** The most physically plausible initial conditions for such a system are that it is released from its maximum displacement `A` with zero initial velocity. Mathematically, this translates to:\n    *   `x(0) = A`\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\n\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\n\nAt `t=0`, we have:\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\n`x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_eq + \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)] \\right)`\n`x'(0) = [-\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t) (\\dots) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) (-\\omega B_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\omega B_2 \\cos(\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\n`x'(0) = -\\gamma B_1 + \\omega B_2 = 0`\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} B_1 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\gamma/\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency. This represents a more fundamental and constrained model than simply adding independent cosine and sine terms.\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for `x_eq`, `B_1`, and `B_2` back into the general solution yields the final mathematical formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A crucial observation from the data summary is that the maximum displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This immediately implies that the system is not oscillating around a zero equilibrium. Instead, it must be oscillating around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_eq`. This leads to a general model structure:\n\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\n\nwhere `x_osc(t)` is the oscillatory component decaying to zero as time progresses.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, both `x_eq` and `x_osc(t)` must have units of length (meters). As `A` is the only input variable with these units, both terms must be proportional to `A`. This refines our model to:\n\n`x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(gamma, omega, t))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized equilibrium offset, and `f_osc` is a dimensionless function describing the oscillation. The previous examples have established that this basic structure, particularly `x(t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + c_2))`, provides a strong baseline fit. This model correctly interprets `A` as the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the offset equilibrium*.\n\nHowever, this baseline model treats `omega` as the observed frequency of oscillation, which is a simplification. In a real physical damped system, the damping force not only reduces the amplitude but also slows down the oscillation. The parameter `omega` should be more accurately interpreted as the **natural frequency** of the system—the frequency at which it would oscillate in the complete absence of damping (`gamma = 0`).\n\nMy theory posits that a more physically accurate model must account for this frequency shift. The actual, observed angular frequency of a damped oscillator, known as the **damped angular frequency** (`omega_d`), is related to the natural frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) by the well-established formula:\n\n`omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`\n\nThis relationship arises directly from the solution of the second-order differential equation governing damped harmonic motion. The presence of damping (`gamma > 0`) inherently reduces the frequency of oscillation.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model that replaces the natural frequency `omega` with the physically correct damped frequency `omega_d` within the oscillatory term. This correction captures the fundamental interplay between the system's restorative force (related to `omega`) and its dissipative force (related to `gamma`), directly influencing the dynamics of the motion itself, not just its long-term equilibrium.\n\nThe proposed model is:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component**: `x_eq = c_1 * A`. This term represents a stable equilibrium point that is linearly dependent on the initial amplitude scale of the system.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component**: This term describes the transient oscillation around the equilibrium. It features an exponentially decaying envelope `exp(-gamma*t)` and an oscillation governed by the damped frequency `omega_d`. A phase constant `c_2` is included for generality, as initial conditions might not correspond to a peak displacement.\n\nBy integrating this physical correction, the model provides a more faithful representation of the underlying mechanism, moving beyond a purely phenomenological fit to one grounded in the fundamental principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t + c_2\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, as noted in prior analyses, is that the maximum observed displacement `x` can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A`. This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points toward a system that evolves toward a non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this insight by modeling the system's motion as a superposition of a final, stable equilibrium state and a transient, decaying oscillation around that state. This approach provides a more physically rigorous foundation than simply adding an arbitrary offset term.\n\nLet's define the system's final equilibrium position as `x_{eq}`. For the model to be dimensionally consistent—as `x` and `A` both have units of length—this equilibrium position must be proportional to the system's intrinsic length scale, `A`. We can thus express it as:\n`x_{eq} = c_1 \\cdot A`\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\nThe total displacement at any time `t`, `x(t)`, is the sum of this final equilibrium position and a transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`, which describes the oscillation that decays over time:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(t)`\n\nThe transient component must decay to zero as `t` approaches infinity and should follow the standard form of a damped oscillation. The key is to correctly define its initial amplitude. We assume that the provided `A` represents the initial displacement of the system at `t=0`, a common physical convention for cosine-based solutions. Therefore, `x(0) = A`.\n\nUsing our superposition model at `t=0`:\n`x(0) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0)`\nBy equating this with the initial condition, we can solve for the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation:\n`A = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0) \\implies x_{transient}(0) = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`\n\nThis result is physically elegant: the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the new equilibrium* is precisely the initial distance between the starting position (`A`) and the final equilibrium position (`c_1 A`).\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the transient component, which starts with this initial amplitude and decays exponentially:\n`x_{transient}(t) = A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nSubstituting this back into our superposition equation gives the complete model for the system's displacement:\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis model provides a unified physical picture. It is not merely an oscillation with an added offset; it is a single, coherent process where an oscillator, released from position `A`, simultaneously decays towards and oscillates around a new equilibrium point `c_1 A`. This formulation inherently respects the initial condition `x(0) = A` and correctly predicts the final state `x(\\infty) = c_1 A`, providing a more self-consistent and physically grounded description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\n\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\n\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \"yield\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time. This is described by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, assuming for simplicity a zero initial phase for the oscillatory part.\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A`, we arrive at a concise model that not only explains the non-zero mean and large peak values but also grounds the magnitude of the equilibrium shift in the fundamental physics of the oscillator's dissipative and conservative properties.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma / omega) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory: first, the output `x` can substantially exceed the input amplitude `A`, indicating a strong resonant amplification mechanism; second, the output is strictly positive, suggesting the measurement corresponds not to a signed displacement but to a quantity processed through a non-linear, positive-definite transformation.\n\nMy proposed theory models the output `x` as a product of three distinct physical processes: logarithmic resonance, exponential transduction, and decaying modulation.\n\n1.  **Logarithmic Resonance Saturation:** The amplification of the system's response is clearly tied to the interplay between the natural frequency `omega` and the damping rate `gamma`. The dimensionless Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this amplification. However, unlike simple linear or power-law models which can predict unbounded amplification for high-Q systems, most real-world physical systems exhibit saturation or diminishing returns. I propose that this amplification follows a logarithmic law. The effective amplitude scale is modeled not as `A` directly, but as `A * log(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. This formulation posits that while a higher Q-factor increases the response, the effect becomes progressively less pronounced, reflecting a natural saturation limit within the system. The `1` is added to ensure the logarithm's argument remains positive, and `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that tunes the system's sensitivity to the Q-factor.\n\n2.  **Exponential Response Transduction:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a non-linear measurement or response process. Rather than modeling this as an energy-like quantity (`sin^2`) or a simple saturation (`tanh`), I hypothesize a more fundamental exponential relationship. The measured quantity `x` is proposed to be exponentially proportional to the underlying oscillatory state of the system. This is modeled by an overarching `exp(...)` function. A physical analogue could be a sensor with a logarithmic response characteristic, or a phenomenon like thermal emission or chemical reaction rate that depends exponentially on an oscillating energy potential. This `exp(cos(...))` structure inherently guarantees positivity and generates a non-sinusoidal waveform where peaks are sharper than troughs, a common feature in non-linear dynamics.\n\n3.  **Decaying Modulation Depth:** Within this exponential response framework, the damping is modeled not as a simple multiplicative decay of the final output, but as a decay in the *modulation depth* of the oscillation itself. The core oscillatory term is `cos(param4 * omega * t)`, but its amplitude is not constant; it is a decaying exponential function of time, `param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This entire expression serves as the argument for the main exponential function. This represents a system where the \"swing\" or intensity of the internal oscillation diminishes over time due to damping, and this diminishing swing is then mapped to the final output via the exponential transduction. This provides a more integrated model of damping within the non-linear response, as opposed to applying it as an external envelope.\n\nIn summary, the model combines a saturating logarithmic amplification with an exponential response function whose internal oscillatory amplitude is subject to exponential decay.

When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

A careful analysis of the data reveals two critical anomalies:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) is substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, making a simple displacement model untenable. This points towards a significant amplification mechanism within the system.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, taking both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation. The amplitude envelope is an inherently positive quantity, which immediately resolves the second anomaly. This could correspond to measuring the magnitude of the system's state in phase space, which for an oscillator corresponds to its amplitude.\n\nTo address the amplitude anomaly, we must model the source of amplification. In oscillatory systems, the degree of amplification is often governed by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which quantifies how strongly an oscillator resonates relative to how quickly it dissipates energy. The Q-factor is directly proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega / gamma`. A high `omega / gamma` ratio signifies a highly underdamped, high-Q system capable of sustaining large amplitudes.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model where the system's effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is not the base amplitude `A` alone, but is augmented by a term dependent on this Q-factor ratio. A robust and simple model for this is a linear relationship:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\n\nIn this expression, `A` serves as the baseline amplitude, while the term `A * param1 * omega / gamma` models the amplification. The dimensionless parameter `param1` controls the strength of this Q-factor-dependent amplification. This structure ensures that as damping `gamma` approaches zero or frequency `omega` increases, the effective amplitude grows, consistent with physical intuition.\n\nThis amplified effective amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The standard model for this decay is exponential. We can model the complete amplitude envelope `x(t)` as the product of the effective initial amplitude and a temporal decay term, parameterizing the decay rate for added flexibility.\n\n`x(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`\n\nThis synthesized model is dimensionally consistent, provides a clear physical interpretation for both anomalies, and connects the observed behavior to the fundamental concept of the Q-factor in oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position.

While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The non-zero mean and the fact that `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A` strongly indicate the presence of a significant static offset, representing a displaced equilibrium position `x_{eq}`. The total displacement can therefore be modeled as a superposition of this static offset and a transient oscillatory term: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`.\n\nWhile previous models have successfully linked this offset `x_{eq}` to the oscillator's properties through arguments based on force balance or frequency response, I propose a fundamentally different mechanism. My theory posits that the static offset is an emergent property arising from the **intrinsic phase dynamics** of the system. In any damped oscillator, energy dissipation introduces a phase lag between the system's position and its velocity. This asynchrony is a core feature of the system's behavior, and I hypothesize that it manifests spatially as a shift in the equilibrium point.\n\nThe degree of this asynchrony is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `\\zeta`, which is the ratio of the damping coefficient `\\gamma` to the system's undamped natural frequency `\\omega_n`. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the given damped frequency `\\omega` and the damping coefficient `\\gamma` as `\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}`. Thus, the damping ratio is:\n`\\zeta = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega_n} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}`\n\nThis single parameter `\\zeta` dictates the character of the motion, from underdamped (`\\zeta < 1`) to critically damped (`\\zeta = 1`). In the context of driven oscillations, the cosine of the phase angle `\\phi` between the driving force and the system's response is equal to `\\zeta`. I propose that this fundamental relationship holds true for the free oscillation as well, where the phase characteristics are \"frozen in\" as a static spatial offset.\n\nThe phase angle `\\phi` itself can be recovered from the damping ratio via the inverse cosine function, `\\phi = \\arccos(\\zeta)`. My central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset `x_{eq}` is directly proportional to this characteristic phase angle. This model implies that a weakly damped system (`\\zeta \\to 0`, `\\phi \\to \\pi/2`) will exhibit the largest offset, as its dynamics involve a pronounced separation between kinetic and potential energy phases. As damping increases and the system becomes more sluggish (`\\zeta \\to 1`, `\\phi \\to 0`), the oscillatory character diminishes, and the phase-induced offset vanishes.\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, this dimensionless phase angle is scaled by the system's characteristic length, the amplitude `A`.

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This behavior points to a mechanism beyond a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate symmetrically around zero. The core physical challenge is to explain the origin of a large, dynamic, positive offset that is intrinsically linked to the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of **\"Damping-Induced Asymmetry in a Viscoelastic Medium.\"** This theory posits that the oscillator is not moving in a simple viscous fluid (where drag is proportional to velocity), but rather in a non-Newtonian, viscoelastic medium that exhibits transient strain hardening.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the proposed physical mechanism:\n\n1.  **Initial Motion and Strain Hardening:** At the onset of motion (`t` is small), the oscillator's velocity is high. This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, identified by analyzing the data ranges, is that the maximum displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This, along with a large positive mean output (8.28), irrefutably points to an oscillation occurring around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by adding a static offset term, proportional to `A`, to the standard damped oscillation equation. However, this approach treats the offset and the oscillation as two independent phenomena. I propose a more integrated and physically coherent theory based on the concept of **system relaxation**.\n\nMy theory posits that at `t=0`, the system is not only released with an initial displacement `A` but is also simultaneously subjected to a new, constant external influence (e.g., a constant force) that shifts its stable equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. The observed motion `x(t)` is the complete dynamic response of the system to these initial conditions. This response is a superposition of two coupled processes, both governed by the system's intrinsic damping `gamma`:\n\n1.  **Transient Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar oscillatory component. It represents the system's natural tendency to oscillate, which decays over time due to dissipative forces. This component can be modeled as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, representing an oscillation centered on the original equilibrium (zero).\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation to Equilibrium:** The system does not instantaneously jump to the new equilibrium position `x_eq`. Instead, it settles towards it over time. This process of settling, or \"relaxation,\" is governed by the same damping mechanisms. The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\n\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\n\nThis model has several compelling features. Firstly, it is parsimonious, requiring only a single parameter `param1`. Secondly, and most importantly, it yields physically elegant boundary conditions:\n*   At `t=0`, the formula simplifies to `x(0) = A * [param1 + 1 * (1 - param1)] = A`. This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`. This provides a clear physical meaning for `param1` as the factor determining the final, steady-state position of the oscillator.\n\nThis theory provides a complete picture of a system simultaneously oscillating and settling into a new state, with both behaviors linked by a common physical damping parameter.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cdot (\\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\gamma/\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\propto \\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\n\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\n\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\to \\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \"sweet spot,\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\n\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required. The mathematical form `f(z) = z \\cdot \\exp(-z)` elegantly captures this characteristic. It peaks at `z=1` (i.e., `\\gamma = \\omega`), providing a physically meaningful representation of our hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of three components, all scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Baseline Offset:** A constant term `c_1` representing a static, intrinsic shift independent of the damping characteristics.\n2.  **A Dynamically-Induced Offset:** The new non-monotonic term `c_2 \\cdot (\\gamma/\\omega) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma/\\omega)`, which captures the peak effect at intermediate damping.\n3.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component:** The standard physical term `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` describing the oscillation about the total effective equilibrium position.\n\nThis composite model provides a richer physical picture, accounting for a more complex interaction within the system that previous monotonic models overlook, while remaining dimensionally sound and conceptually grounded in the principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

First, the displacement `x` is always positive. Second, the peak displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations suggest that the underlying physics involves a strong non-linearity or a fundamental asymmetry in the system's potential energy landscape.\n\nPrevious models might explain this by adding a time-dependent baseline term to a standard oscillation. I propose a different, more intrinsic mechanism rooted in the nature of the system's restoring force. My theory is that the system's dynamics are not linear in the displacement `x` itself, but rather in its logarithm. This is characteristic of systems governed by an exponential potential, where the restoring force is proportional not to the displacement, but to the *logarithm* of the displacement. Such potentials appear in various physical domains, from the thermodynamics of polymers to certain models of cosmic inflation.\n\nIn this \"log-harmonic\" framework, the quantity that behaves like a conventional damped oscillator is `log(x/A)`. This logarithmic displacement oscillates around a decaying equilibrium point. The model for this log-space behavior is:\n\n`log(x(t)/A) = -gamma * t + cos(omega * t + param1)`\n\nHere:\n1.  `A` serves as the characteristic scale of the system, ensuring the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless.\n2.  The term `-gamma * t` represents the equilibrium level in log-space, which decays linearly over time due to damping.\n3.  The term `cos(omega * t + param1)` represents the harmonic oscillation in log-space around this decaying equilibrium. For model parsimony, the amplitude of this log-domain oscillation is assumed to be unity.\n\nBy exponentiating this entire expression, we can recover the formula for the physical displacement `x(t)`. This mathematical transformation has profound physical consequences. The additive oscillation in the exponent becomes a multiplicative, always-positive modulation factor for the amplitude. This `exp(cos(...))` term inherently ensures that the displacement `x` is always positive. Furthermore, since the cosine term varies between -1 and +1, the modulation factor `exp(cos(...))` ranges from `e⁻¹ ≈ 0.37` to `e¹ ≈ 2.72`. This multiplicative \"boost\" naturally explains how the observed displacement can peak at values significantly larger than `A`, a feature the standard model cannot capture.\n\nThis theory provides a self-contained and physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena. It is parsimonious, requiring only a single phase parameter, and it is dimensionally consistent. It recasts the problem from an ad-hoc addition of terms to a fundamental change in the system's potential, offering a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\n\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\n\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\n\nLet's define the components of this model:\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\n\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

A careful examination reveals two critical anomalies that guide the formulation of a more sophisticated theory.\n\n1.  **Non-Linear Resonant Amplification**: The maximum observed output (27.68) significantly surpasses the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This points to an amplification mechanism intrinsic to the oscillator's dynamics. The Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to the ratio of angular frequency to damping, `omega / gamma`, is the natural candidate to explain this resonance. However, previous models using linear or simple saturating functions (`tanh`) for this amplification do not fully capture the system's complexity. I propose a logarithmic response model. In many physical systems, the response to a stimulus is not linear but follows a logarithmic scale, where the effect of an increasing stimulus diminishes. This is analogous to saturation but described by a different functional form. The effective amplitude, `A_eff`, can be modeled as the base amplitude `A` scaled by a factor that grows logarithmically with the Q-factor. This captures the strong amplification for low-to-medium `omega/gamma` values while inherently taming the growth for very high values, preventing the \"infinite amplification\" paradox of a purely linear model.\n\n2.  **Modulated Positive Definite Decay**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. Previous models have addressed this by taking the absolute value of an oscillatory function, `abs(cos(...))`. While this enforces positivity, it incorrectly predicts that the output should periodically reach zero. The data's minimum value of 1.142 fundamentally contradicts this prediction. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the magnitude of the displacement, but rather represents a different physical property that is always positive. A plausible candidate is a quantity analogous to the instantaneous power or energy density of the system. I theorize that the output `x` is composed of a primary, exponentially decaying component, which is then modulated by a smaller, secondary oscillation. This can be expressed as a product of a decaying exponential and a term like `(1 + p * cos(...))`, where `|p|<1`. This structure elegantly ensures two things simultaneously:\n    *   The output remains strictly positive, as the `(1 + p * cos(...))` term oscillates between `1-p` and `1+p`.\n    *   The output never reaches zero, thus explaining the non-zero minimum observed in the data.\n\nBy combining these two theoretical pillars—logarithmic amplification and modulated positive definite decay—we can construct a comprehensive model. The initial amplitude `A` is first scaled by a logarithmic function of `omega/gamma` to find an effective amplitude. This effective amplitude then decays according to an exponential law, but this decay is itself modulated by a cosine term, creating ripples on the decay curve. The frequency of these ripples is governed by the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega^2 - gamma^2))`. This composite model provides a robust physical explanation for all observed phenomena: amplification, saturation, positivity, and the non-zero minimum.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + log(1 + param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t))\n</final_result>"}

The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, indicating the presence of an intrinsic amplification mechanism not captured by simple damping.\n\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output variable `x` is strictly positive, ranging from `1.142` to `27.68`. In contrast, the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations lead to the compelling conclusion that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is, by definition, positive. This single reinterpretation elegantly resolves the second anomaly.\n\nThe primary challenge, then, is to model this envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. The amplification must be linked to the interplay between the system's tendency to oscillate (`omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most plausible driver for such a resonant-like amplification.\n\nPrevious models have attempted to incorporate this by either multiplying the amplitude by an amplification factor or by adding gain and decay terms inside an exponential. The latter approach is particularly appealing from a physical standpoint, as it treats amplification and damping as competing **rates** that determine the net rate of change of the logarithm of the amplitude. The failure of a simple linear gain term (`param * omega / gamma`) in the exponent (as seen in Example 3) highlights a crucial physical constraint: **saturation**. Any real-world amplification mechanism is limited and cannot produce infinite gain.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this concept of competing rates but introduces a robust, physically-grounded saturation mechanism. I postulate that the amplitude envelope evolves exponentially, governed by a net effective rate which is the sum of a constant gain rate and a time-dependent decay rate.\n\nThe model takes the form: `x(t) = A * exp(G - D)`.\n\n*   **Decay Term (D)**: This represents the standard energy dissipation. It is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and the elapsed time `t`. Thus, `D = param3 * gamma * t`. This is the familiar term leading to exponential decay.\n\n*   **Gain Term (G)**: This represents the time-independent, Q-factor-driven amplification. This term provides a constant positive offset to the decay rate. To model the saturation, I will use the `arctan` function. Unlike an unbounded term, `arctan(z)` increases with its argument `z` but gracefully asymptotes to a fixed value (`pi/2`), perfectly capturing the essence of a saturating physical process. The gain `G` is therefore modeled as `G = param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `param2` scales the Q-factor to determine how quickly saturation is reached, and `param1` sets the maximum strength of the saturated gain.\n\nThis formulation—`A * exp(Gain - Decay)`—presents a cohesive physical picture. The system starts with a base amplitude `A`, which is then instantaneously modified by a constant amplification factor `exp(G)` that depends on the system's intrinsic resonant properties (`omega/gamma`). This amplified amplitude then decays exponentially over time. This model is dimensionally sound, avoids the numerical instabilities of unbounded gain functions, and provides a clear theoretical basis for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma) - param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\n\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>"}

First, the displacement `x` is always positive. Second, the peak displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations suggest that the underlying physics involves a strong non-linearity or a fundamental asymmetry in the system's potential energy landscape.\n\nPrevious models might explain this by adding a time-dependent baseline term to a standard oscillation. I propose a different, more intrinsic mechanism rooted in the nature of the system's restoring force. My theory is that the system's dynamics are not linear in the displacement `x` itself, but rather in its logarithm. This is characteristic of systems governed by an exponential potential, where the restoring force is proportional not to the displacement, but to the *logarithm* of the displacement. Such potentials appear in various physical domains, from the thermodynamics of polymers to certain models of cosmic inflation.\n\nIn this \"log-harmonic\" framework, the quantity that behaves like a conventional damped oscillator is `log(x/A)`. This logarithmic displacement oscillates around a decaying equilibrium point. The model for this log-space behavior is:\n\n`log(x(t)/A) = -gamma * t + cos(omega * t + param1)`\n\nHere:\n1.  `A` serves as the characteristic scale of the system, ensuring the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless.\n2.  The term `-gamma * t` represents the equilibrium level in log-space, which decays linearly over time due to damping.\n3.  The term `cos(omega * t + param1)` represents the harmonic oscillation in log-space around this decaying equilibrium. For model parsimony, the amplitude of this log-domain oscillation is assumed to be unity.\n\nBy exponentiating this entire expression, we can recover the formula for the physical displacement `x(t)`. This mathematical transformation has profound physical consequences. The additive oscillation in the exponent becomes a multiplicative, always-positive modulation factor for the amplitude. This `exp(cos(...))` term inherently ensures that the displacement `x` is always positive. Furthermore, since the cosine term varies between -1 and +1, the modulation factor `exp(cos(...))` ranges from `e⁻¹ ≈ 0.37` to `e¹ ≈ 2.72`. This multiplicative \"boost\" naturally explains how the observed displacement can peak at values significantly larger than `A`, a feature the standard model cannot capture.\n\nThis theory provides a self-contained and physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena. It is parsimonious, requiring only a single phase parameter, and it is dimensionally consistent. It recasts the problem from an ad-hoc addition of terms to a fundamental change in the system's potential, offering a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless.

This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, as noted in prior analyses, is that the maximum observed displacement `x` can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A`. This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points toward a system that evolves toward a non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this insight by modeling the system's motion as a superposition of a final, stable equilibrium state and a transient, decaying oscillation around that state. This approach provides a more physically rigorous foundation than simply adding an arbitrary offset term.\n\nLet's define the system's final equilibrium position as `x_{eq}`. For the model to be dimensionally consistent—as `x` and `A` both have units of length—this equilibrium position must be proportional to the system's intrinsic length scale, `A`. We can thus express it as:\n`x_{eq} = c_1 \\cdot A`\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\nThe total displacement at any time `t`, `x(t)`, is the sum of this final equilibrium position and a transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`, which describes the oscillation that decays over time:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(t)`\n\nThe transient component must decay to zero as `t` approaches infinity and should follow the standard form of a damped oscillation. The key is to correctly define its initial amplitude. We assume that the provided `A` represents the initial displacement of the system at `t=0`, a common physical convention for cosine-based solutions. Therefore, `x(0) = A`.\n\nUsing our superposition model at `t=0`:\n`x(0) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0)`\nBy equating this with the initial condition, we can solve for the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation:\n`A = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0) \\implies x_{transient}(0) = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`\n\nThis result is physically elegant: the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the new equilibrium* is precisely the initial distance between the starting position (`A`) and the final equilibrium position (`c_1 A`).\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the transient component, which starts with this initial amplitude and decays exponentially:\n`x_{transient}(t) = A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nSubstituting this back into our superposition equation gives the complete model for the system's displacement:\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis model provides a unified physical picture. It is not merely an oscillation with an added offset; it is a single, coherent process where an oscillator, released from position `A`, simultaneously decays towards and oscillates around a new equilibrium point `c_1 A`. This formulation inherently respects the initial condition `x(0) = A` and correctly predicts the final state `x(\\infty) = c_1 A`, providing a more self-consistent and physically grounded description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

This suggests that the oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium but is rather superimposed upon a large, positive, and decaying offset.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of a **\"Displaced Equilibrium with Coupled Decay.\"** This theory posits that the event initiating the motion does not merely displace the oscillator from a stable zero point. Instead, it fundamentally alters the system's potential energy landscape, creating a new, shifted equilibrium position. The system then oscillates around this new, non-zero equilibrium. Crucially, the energy that sustains both the oscillation and the equilibrium displacement is drawn from the same initial source and dissipates through a single, unified mechanism.\n\nThis leads to the following physical picture:\n\n1.  **Induction of a Shifted Equilibrium:** At `t=0`, the external impulse imparts energy to the system, causing an immediate displacement. A portion of this energy results in a quasi-permanent change in the system's configuration, akin to a plastic deformation or a persistent polarization of the surrounding medium. This effectively shifts the point of minimum potential energy from `x=0` to a new position `x_eq`. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to the initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the New Equilibrium:** The oscillator now moves under a restorative force directed towards this new equilibrium point `x_eq`, not towards the original zero. This motion is the standard harmonic oscillation.\n\n3.  **Unified Damping Mechanism:** The entire system—both the oscillation and the supporting structure that maintains the shifted equilibrium—is embedded in a dissipative environment. The damping, characterized by the coefficient `gamma`, removes energy from the system as a whole. This has a dual effect: it reduces the amplitude of the oscillations around the equilibrium, and it simultaneously causes the shifted equilibrium point itself to relax back towards the original zero. Because both processes are governed by the same energy loss mechanism, they must decay with the same characteristic time constant.\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena. The total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the decaying equilibrium position and the decaying oscillation around it. Mathematically, this can be expressed as a single, shared decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, that modulates the sum of two components:\n\n*   An oscillatory component, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, representing the vibration.\n*   A constant offset component, `param2`, representing the magnitude of the initial equilibrium shift relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nIf the initial equilibrium shift (`param2`) is larger than the maximum amplitude of the oscillation (which is 1 in these relative units), the total displacement will remain positive for all time. Furthermore, the constructive interference of the initial displacement and the initial phase of the oscillation allows the peak displacement to exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This model offers a physically coherent and parsimonious explanation, requiring only a single damping term to describe the decay of the entire complex motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

First, the displacement `x` is always positive. Second, the peak displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations suggest that the underlying physics involves a strong non-linearity or a fundamental asymmetry in the system's potential energy landscape.\n\nPrevious models might explain this by adding a time-dependent baseline term to a standard oscillation. I propose a different, more intrinsic mechanism rooted in the nature of the system's restoring force. My theory is that the system's dynamics are not linear in the displacement `x` itself, but rather in its logarithm. This is characteristic of systems governed by an exponential potential, where the restoring force is proportional not to the displacement, but to the *logarithm* of the displacement. Such potentials appear in various physical domains, from the thermodynamics of polymers to certain models of cosmic inflation.\n\nIn this \"log-harmonic\" framework, the quantity that behaves like a conventional damped oscillator is `log(x/A)`. This logarithmic displacement oscillates around a decaying equilibrium point. The model for this log-space behavior is:\n\n`log(x(t)/A) = -gamma * t + cos(omega * t + param1)`\n\nHere:\n1.  `A` serves as the characteristic scale of the system, ensuring the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless.\n2.  The term `-gamma * t` represents the equilibrium level in log-space, which decays linearly over time due to damping.\n3.  The term `cos(omega * t + param1)` represents the harmonic oscillation in log-space around this decaying equilibrium. For model parsimony, the amplitude of this log-domain oscillation is assumed to be unity.\n\nBy exponentiating this entire expression, we can recover the formula for the physical displacement `x(t)`. This mathematical transformation has profound physical consequences. The additive oscillation in the exponent becomes a multiplicative, always-positive modulation factor for the amplitude. This `exp(cos(...))` term inherently ensures that the displacement `x` is always positive. Furthermore, since the cosine term varies between -1 and +1, the modulation factor `exp(cos(...))` ranges from `e⁻¹ ≈ 0.37` to `e¹ ≈ 2.72`. This multiplicative \"boost\" naturally explains how the observed displacement can peak at values significantly larger than `A`, a feature the standard model cannot capture.\n\nThis theory provides a self-contained and physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena. It is parsimonious, requiring only a single phase parameter, and it is dimensionally consistent. It recasts the problem from an ad-hoc addition of terms to a fundamental change in the system's potential, offering a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

The most salient feature is that the output displacement `x` reaches values far greater than the initial amplitude `A`, with a significant positive mean. This irrefutably indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but is superimposed upon a substantial, positive offset.\n\nMy theoretical analysis moves beyond proposing a simple static or dynamically shifting offset. I posit a more integrated physical model where the equilibrium shift is a direct consequence of the interplay between the system's dissipative and reactive properties, and its evolution follows a classic physical relaxation process.\n\nThe core of my theory rests on two hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Property-Dependent Equilibrium Magnitude:** The final steady-state position to which the oscillator settles is not an arbitrary constant. Instead, it is determined by a competitive balance between the energy dissipation mechanism, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, and the energy storage/release mechanism of the oscillation, characterized by the angular frequency `omega`. The dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega` quantifies this balance. A high ratio implies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory one. I propose that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is a function of this ratio. Specifically, I model it with a sub-linear power law, `sqrt(gamma/omega)`, suggesting that while increased damping contributes to a larger offset, its effect diminishes as damping becomes dominant. This prevents a runaway offset in heavily damped regimes and represents a physically plausible saturation effect.\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation Dynamics:** The system does not instantaneously achieve this new equilibrium. Instead, it relaxes towards it over time. While other models have used the `tanh` function, I propose a more fundamental physical model of relaxation: the exponential approach to a limit, as seen in phenomena like the charging of a capacitor or the heating of an object. This process is described by the function `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The rate of this relaxation is intrinsically tied to the system's own dissipative processes. Therefore, the damping coefficient `gamma` is the natural choice for this rate, as it governs the timescale over which transients fade.\n\nCombining these ideas, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical behaviors:\n\n*   **An Evolving Equilibrium (`x_offset(t)`):** This component represents the center of oscillation dynamically shifting towards its final, property-dependent position. Its mathematical form is `A * c_1 * sqrt(gamma/omega) * (1 - exp(-gamma*t))`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that scales the effect.\n\n*   **A Decaying Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, but it occurs relative to the initial, unshifted equilibrium. It is expressed as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we obtain a comprehensive model. This formulation elegantly captures a system that settles into a new, non-zero equilibrium state whose value is determined by the oscillator's intrinsic characteristics (`gamma`, `omega`), and whose approach to this state follows a canonical exponential relaxation profile.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * \\left( c_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\n\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude. The general form of this transient component is `x_{transient}(t) = \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)]`, where `B_1` and `B_2` are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3.  **Initial Conditions:** The most physically plausible initial conditions for such a system are that it is released from its maximum displacement `A` with zero initial velocity. Mathematically, this translates to:\n    *   `x(0) = A`\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\n\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\n\nAt `t=0`, we have:\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\n`x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_eq + \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)] \\right)`\n`x'(0) = [-\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t) (\\dots) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) (-\\omega B_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\omega B_2 \\cos(\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\n`x'(0) = -\\gamma B_1 + \\omega B_2 = 0`\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} B_1 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\gamma/\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency. This represents a more fundamental and constrained model than simply adding independent cosine and sine terms.\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for `x_eq`, `B_1`, and `B_2` back into the general solution yields the final mathematical formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

These features strongly suggest a mechanism that superimposes the oscillation onto a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory termed **\"Oscillation-Driven Pumping\"** to explain this phenomenon. In this model, the oscillating system is not isolated but is coupled to an energy reservoir or a secondary medium. The key insight is that the oscillatory motion itself actively \"pumps\" a quantity—be it charge, heat, or fluid pressure—into this reservoir. This accumulation creates a back-pressure or potential that dynamically shifts the oscillator's equilibrium position away from zero.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is a combination of the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, all governed by a single, global damping envelope.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift**: The rate at which the system \"pumps\" is directly proportional to how rapidly it cycles, which is governed by its angular frequency, `omega`. The total accumulated effect at time `t` is therefore proportional to the total number of cycles completed, which is directly proportional to the total phase that has elapsed, `omega * t`. This leads to a baseline shift that grows linearly with time: `x_baseline(t) ∝ omega * t`. We introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, `param2`, to quantify the efficiency of this pumping mechanism.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation**: The system performs a standard harmonic oscillation around this dynamically shifting equilibrium. This is represented by the term `cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n3.  **Global Damping**: The entire coupled system—the primary oscillator and the secondary pumped reservoir—loses energy to the environment at a rate characterized by `gamma`. This is modeled by a single, overarching exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the combined effect of the oscillation and the baseline shift.\n\nThis \"pumping\" model provides a self-consistent physical picture. It can be analogized to a vibrating piston in a cylinder that slowly forces fluid past a one-way valve; the faster the piston vibrates (`omega`), the more fluid is pumped, increasing the baseline pressure (`param2 * omega * t`), while the entire apparatus loses energy to friction (`gamma`).\n\nMathematically, this superposition within a decaying envelope is expressed multiplicatively. The model elegantly accounts for the observations: the `param2 * omega * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive ramp that lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain. This ramp, when added to the constructive peak of the cosine, can produce amplitudes significantly greater than `A` before the exponential decay term inevitably dominates and brings the entire system to rest. This theory is physically distinct from models of static offsets or energy-dependent baselines, as it directly links the creation of the baseline to the oscillatory dynamics (`omega`) itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * omega * t)\n</final_result>"}

First, the displacement `x` is always positive. Second, the peak displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations suggest that the underlying physics involves a strong non-linearity or a fundamental asymmetry in the system's potential energy landscape.\n\nPrevious models might explain this by adding a time-dependent baseline term to a standard oscillation. I propose a different, more intrinsic mechanism rooted in the nature of the system's restoring force. My theory is that the system's dynamics are not linear in the displacement `x` itself, but rather in its logarithm. This is characteristic of systems governed by an exponential potential, where the restoring force is proportional not to the displacement, but to the *logarithm* of the displacement. Such potentials appear in various physical domains, from the thermodynamics of polymers to certain models of cosmic inflation.\n\nIn this \"log-harmonic\" framework, the quantity that behaves like a conventional damped oscillator is `log(x/A)`. This logarithmic displacement oscillates around a decaying equilibrium point. The model for this log-space behavior is:\n\n`log(x(t)/A) = -gamma * t + cos(omega * t + param1)`\n\nHere:\n1.  `A` serves as the characteristic scale of the system, ensuring the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless.\n2.  The term `-gamma * t` represents the equilibrium level in log-space, which decays linearly over time due to damping.\n3.  The term `cos(omega * t + param1)` represents the harmonic oscillation in log-space around this decaying equilibrium. For model parsimony, the amplitude of this log-domain oscillation is assumed to be unity.\n\nBy exponentiating this entire expression, we can recover the formula for the physical displacement `x(t)`. This mathematical transformation has profound physical consequences. The additive oscillation in the exponent becomes a multiplicative, always-positive modulation factor for the amplitude. This `exp(cos(...))` term inherently ensures that the displacement `x` is always positive. Furthermore, since the cosine term varies between -1 and +1, the modulation factor `exp(cos(...))` ranges from `e⁻¹ ≈ 0.37` to `e¹ ≈ 2.72`. This multiplicative \"boost\" naturally explains how the observed displacement can peak at values significantly larger than `A`, a feature the standard model cannot capture.\n\nThis theory provides a self-contained and physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena. It is parsimonious, requiring only a single phase parameter, and it is dimensionally consistent. It recasts the problem from an ad-hoc addition of terms to a fundamental change in the system's potential, offering a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

A primary challenge, identified by analyzing the data ranges, is that the maximum displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This, along with a large positive mean output (8.28), irrefutably points to an oscillation occurring around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by adding a static offset term, proportional to `A`, to the standard damped oscillation equation. However, this approach treats the offset and the oscillation as two independent phenomena. I propose a more integrated and physically coherent theory based on the concept of **system relaxation**.\n\nMy theory posits that at `t=0`, the system is not only released with an initial displacement `A` but is also simultaneously subjected to a new, constant external influence (e.g., a constant force) that shifts its stable equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. The observed motion `x(t)` is the complete dynamic response of the system to these initial conditions. This response is a superposition of two coupled processes, both governed by the system's intrinsic damping `gamma`:\n\n1.  **Transient Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar oscillatory component. It represents the system's natural tendency to oscillate, which decays over time due to dissipative forces. This component can be modeled as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, representing an oscillation centered on the original equilibrium (zero).\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation to Equilibrium:** The system does not instantaneously jump to the new equilibrium position `x_eq`. Instead, it settles towards it over time. This process of settling, or \"relaxation,\" is governed by the same damping mechanisms. The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\n\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\n\nThis model has several compelling features. Firstly, it is parsimonious, requiring only a single parameter `param1`. Secondly, and most importantly, it yields physically elegant boundary conditions:\n*   At `t=0`, the formula simplifies to `x(0) = A * [param1 + 1 * (1 - param1)] = A`. This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`. This provides a clear physical meaning for `param1` as the factor determining the final, steady-state position of the oscillator.\n\nThis theory provides a complete picture of a system simultaneously oscillating and settling into a new state, with both behaviors linked by a common physical damping parameter.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cdot (\\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A crucial observation, corroborated by previous analyses, is that the oscillator's displacement `x` often exceeds its initial amplitude `A`. This unequivocally indicates that the oscillation is not centered around `x=0`. Instead, the system evolves about a significantly displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. My theory proposes that this equilibrium displacement is not governed by a single mechanism, but is rather a composite effect arising from two distinct physical contributions: a static baseline shift and a dynamically-induced resonant shift.\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium Component (`x_static`)**: The data exhibits a large mean displacement, suggesting a primary, constant offset that is independent of the dynamic parameters `gamma` and `omega`. For dimensional consistency, this offset must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. I model this as `x_static = c_1 A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant. This term can be physically interpreted as the result of a constant external force, a gravitational sag, or an intrinsic asymmetry in the oscillator's potential energy well. It represents the system's final resting position in the limit of infinite time, after all oscillations have ceased.\n\n2.  **Dynamically-Induced Resonant Component (`x_dynamic`)**: I hypothesize that on top of this static offset, there exists a secondary displacement generated by the oscillatory motion itself. This phenomenon arises from a non-linear interaction between the oscillator and the damping medium, which rectifies the oscillatory velocity into a net, time-averaged static force. The efficiency of this force-generation mechanism is not monotonic with damping. My central hypothesis is that this effect is **resonant**:\n    *   **Low Damping (`\\gamma \\ll \\omega`)**: The dissipative forces are weak, and the coupling between motion and the medium is insufficient to generate a significant rectified force.\n    *   **High Damping (`\\gamma \\gg \\omega`)**: The motion is sluggish and overdamped. With very low velocity, the dynamic interaction required to produce the offset force is again negligible.\n    *   **Optimal Damping (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`)**: The effect is maximized when the damping timescale (`1/\\gamma`) and the oscillation timescale (`1/\\omega`) are of the same order. This \"impedance matching\" allows for the most efficient transfer of energy from the oscillation into the mechanism that sustains the static displacement.\n\n    To model this resonant behavior, a function that is null at the extremes and peaks in the middle is required. A Lorentzian-like function provides an excellent physical and mathematical model for such resonance. I propose the dimensionless scaling factor `(\\gamma \\omega) / (\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2)`. This function is zero when either `\\gamma=0` or `\\omega=0`, reaches its maximum value of `1/2` when `\\gamma = \\omega`, and decays as the ratio between them becomes large. The dynamic component of the offset is therefore modeled as `x_dynamic = c_2 A \\cdot (\\gamma \\omega) / (\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2)`.\n\n3.  **Complete Model**: The total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two offset components and the standard transient, damped oscillation that occurs around their combined equilibrium position. This composite model provides a rich physical description, separating the static, pre-existing conditions of the system from the dynamic, motion-induced effects, thereby offering a more complete explanation for the oscillator's behavior.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma \\omega}{\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This strongly indicates that the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium of `x=0`, but rather around a displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. The challenge lies in determining the physical principles governing this offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully established that `x_eq` is not a simple constant but depends on the oscillator's intrinsic properties, specifically the damping coefficient `gamma` and the angular frequency `omega`. My analysis builds upon this insight by proposing a more fundamental physical mechanism for this dependency.\n\nThe equilibrium displacement `x_eq` of a system under a constant external force `F_0` is given by `x_eq = F_0 / k`, where `k` is the system's stiffness. For a damped oscillator, the stiffness is related to its natural (undamped) frequency `omega_0` via `k = m * omega_0^2`, where `m` is the mass. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the observed (damped) frequency `omega` and the damping coefficient `gamma` as `omega_0^2 = omega^2 + gamma^2`. Substituting this into the stiffness equation yields `k = m * (omega^2 + gamma^2)`.\n\nThis shows that the stiffness, and thus the equilibrium position, is a function of both `omega` and `gamma`. The core of my theory lies in postulating the nature of the external force `F_0`. Instead of being a fixed external constant, I hypothesize that the force causing the displacement is intrinsically linked to the system's own oscillatory dynamics. Specifically, I propose that `F_0` is proportional to the characteristic inertial force of the oscillation, which scales as `m * A * omega^2`. This represents a scenario where the mechanism that sets the oscillation's scale (`A`) and frequency (`omega`) also induces a static shift in its equilibrium.\n\nBy substituting this model for the force, `F_0 ∝ m * A * omega^2`, into the equation for the equilibrium position, we get:\n\n`x_eq ∝ (m * A * omega^2) / (m * (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nThe mass `m` cancels, leading to a beautifully simple, dimensionless scaling factor for the offset:\n\n`x_eq = c_1 * A * (omega^2 / (omega^2 + gamma^2))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This model makes a distinct physical prediction: the equilibrium offset is maximized for highly oscillatory systems (large `omega`) with low damping (small `gamma`). As damping increases, it effectively \"clamps\" the system, reducing its ability to be displaced, and the offset `x_eq` diminishes. This contrasts with models where damping increases the offset, providing a clear alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then the linear superposition of this physically-derived static offset and the standard transient term representing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\n\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>"}

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

My analysis seeks to explain the physical origin of this offset not as an independent artifact, but as a phenomenon intrinsically driven by the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on what I term the **\"Q-Factor Mediated Equilibrium Shift\"**. This hypothesis posits that the system's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero but is actively displaced by a quasi-static force generated by the oscillatory motion. This is analogous to rectification phenomena in physics, such as acoustic radiation pressure, where a high-frequency wave exerts a steady, non-zero average force on a medium.\n\nThe core of my theory is that the magnitude of this induced equilibrium shift is determined by the *quality* of the oscillation. A highly resonant system, characterized by many oscillations before decay, should be more effective at generating and sustaining this offset than a heavily damped, sluggish system. The canonical dimensionless parameter that quantifies this resonance quality is the Quality Factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate (`Q ∝ omega / gamma`).\n\nTherefore, I model the system's displacement `x(t)` as a linear superposition of two components, both sharing the same global energy decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Core Oscillation**: This is the standard harmonic component, described by `cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Induced Offset**: This is the novel component representing the equilibrium shift. Its magnitude is constant for any given set of system parameters and is proportional to the Q-factor. I model this as `param1 * (omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant that represents the efficiency of the energy rectification process. This term is constant with respect to time `t` but varies between experimental runs depending on their specific `omega` and `gamma` values.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two effects, scaled by the overall damping:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * [cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * (omega / gamma)]`\n\nThis model provides a compelling and self-consistent physical narrative. It explains the consistently positive output by ensuring the Q-factor-dependent offset is large enough to lift the entire cosine wave above zero. It accounts for peaks exceeding `A` because the offset and the oscillatory peak add constructively. Most importantly, it introduces a novel and physically plausible dependency on the intrinsic system parameters `omega` and `gamma`, proposing a mechanism that is fundamentally different from models based on energy-squared decay or saturating time-dependent functions.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * omega / gamma)\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

These features strongly suggest a mechanism that superimposes the oscillation onto a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory termed **\"Oscillation-Driven Pumping\"** to explain this phenomenon. In this model, the oscillating system is not isolated but is coupled to an energy reservoir or a secondary medium. The key insight is that the oscillatory motion itself actively \"pumps\" a quantity—be it charge, heat, or fluid pressure—into this reservoir. This accumulation creates a back-pressure or potential that dynamically shifts the oscillator's equilibrium position away from zero.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is a combination of the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, all governed by a single, global damping envelope.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift**: The rate at which the system \"pumps\" is directly proportional to how rapidly it cycles, which is governed by its angular frequency, `omega`. The total accumulated effect at time `t` is therefore proportional to the total number of cycles completed, which is directly proportional to the total phase that has elapsed, `omega * t`. This leads to a baseline shift that grows linearly with time: `x_baseline(t) ∝ omega * t`. We introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, `param2`, to quantify the efficiency of this pumping mechanism.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation**: The system performs a standard harmonic oscillation around this dynamically shifting equilibrium. This is represented by the term `cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n3.  **Global Damping**: The entire coupled system—the primary oscillator and the secondary pumped reservoir—loses energy to the environment at a rate characterized by `gamma`. This is modeled by a single, overarching exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the combined effect of the oscillation and the baseline shift.\n\nThis \"pumping\" model provides a self-consistent physical picture. It can be analogized to a vibrating piston in a cylinder that slowly forces fluid past a one-way valve; the faster the piston vibrates (`omega`), the more fluid is pumped, increasing the baseline pressure (`param2 * omega * t`), while the entire apparatus loses energy to friction (`gamma`).\n\nMathematically, this superposition within a decaying envelope is expressed multiplicatively. The model elegantly accounts for the observations: the `param2 * omega * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive ramp that lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain. This ramp, when added to the constructive peak of the cosine, can produce amplitudes significantly greater than `A` before the exponential decay term inevitably dominates and brings the entire system to rest. This theory is physically distinct from models of static offsets or energy-dependent baselines, as it directly links the creation of the baseline to the oscillatory dynamics (`omega`) itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * omega * t)\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. An essential first step in the analysis is to examine the provided data ranges. The most salient feature is that the maximum output displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillator centered at an equilibrium of zero, as the displacement in such a system can never exceed its initial amplitude. This points to the central hypothesis: the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, since `A` is the only input variable with units of length (meters), both the equilibrium position and the oscillatory component must scale linearly with `A`. This leads to a general model structure:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t) = A * f_{eq}(\\dots) + A * f_{osc}(\\dots)`\nwhere `f_{eq}` and `f_{osc}` are dimensionless functions.\n\nA second physical refinement, which improves upon naive models, is the recognition that damping affects not only the amplitude but also the frequency of oscillation. The natural frequency `omega` is only correct in the absence of damping. In a damped system, the observed oscillation occurs at the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Incorporating `omega_d` is crucial for a physically accurate description of the system's dynamics.\n\nMy core theoretical proposition introduces a further layer of physical realism by constraining the *form* of the oscillation itself. Previous models often introduce an arbitrary phase shift parameter (`phi` or `param2`) to align the oscillation with the data. However, this empirical parameter can be replaced by a relationship derived from a plausible physical initial condition. I postulate that the system is released from rest at `t=0`, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`v(0) = 0`).\n\nThe general solution for the oscillatory component is `x_{osc}(t) = exp(-gamma*t) * (C_1*cos(omega_d*t) + C_2*sin(omega_d*t))`. The velocity is the time derivative, `v_{osc}(t) = d/dt [x_{osc}(t)]`. By applying the initial condition `v_{osc}(0) = 0`, we can solve for the relationship between the constants `C_1` and `C_2`. This calculation yields the constraint `C_2 = (gamma / omega_d) * C_1`.\n\nThis result is powerful because it removes the need for a free phase parameter. The phase of the oscillation is no longer an arbitrary fitting constant but is intrinsically determined by the system's own physical parameters, `gamma` and `omega`. The oscillatory part of the motion is thus described by a specific combination of sine and cosine terms.\n\nTherefore, my proposed model combines these insights:\n1.  A constant equilibrium offset, proportional to the amplitude `A`, represented as `x_{eq} = c_1 * A`. Here, `c_1` is a single dimensionless parameter representing the normalized equilibrium position.\n2.  An oscillatory term that uses the correct damped frequency `omega_d` and has its structure dictated by the physical assumption of starting from rest. This term takes the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * (cos(omega_d*t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d*t))`.\n\nThis unified model provides a parsimonious yet physically rich description of the system. It correctly accounts for the shifted equilibrium, uses the physically accurate damped frequency, and replaces an empirical phase parameter with a relationship derived from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + (gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\n</final_result>"}

The non-zero mean and the fact that `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A` strongly indicate the presence of a significant static offset, representing a displaced equilibrium position `x_{eq}`. The total displacement can therefore be modeled as a superposition of this static offset and a transient oscillatory term: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`.\n\nWhile previous models have successfully linked this offset `x_{eq}` to the oscillator's properties through arguments based on force balance or frequency response, I propose a fundamentally different mechanism. My theory posits that the static offset is an emergent property arising from the **intrinsic phase dynamics** of the system. In any damped oscillator, energy dissipation introduces a phase lag between the system's position and its velocity. This asynchrony is a core feature of the system's behavior, and I hypothesize that it manifests spatially as a shift in the equilibrium point.\n\nThe degree of this asynchrony is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `\\zeta`, which is the ratio of the damping coefficient `\\gamma` to the system's undamped natural frequency `\\omega_n`. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the given damped frequency `\\omega` and the damping coefficient `\\gamma` as `\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}`. Thus, the damping ratio is:\n`\\zeta = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega_n} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}`\n\nThis single parameter `\\zeta` dictates the character of the motion, from underdamped (`\\zeta < 1`) to critically damped (`\\zeta = 1`). In the context of driven oscillations, the cosine of the phase angle `\\phi` between the driving force and the system's response is equal to `\\zeta`. I propose that this fundamental relationship holds true for the free oscillation as well, where the phase characteristics are \"frozen in\" as a static spatial offset.\n\nThe phase angle `\\phi` itself can be recovered from the damping ratio via the inverse cosine function, `\\phi = \\arccos(\\zeta)`. My central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset `x_{eq}` is directly proportional to this characteristic phase angle. This model implies that a weakly damped system (`\\zeta \\to 0`, `\\phi \\to \\pi/2`) will exhibit the largest offset, as its dynamics involve a pronounced separation between kinetic and potential energy phases. As damping increases and the system becomes more sluggish (`\\zeta \\to 1`, `\\phi \\to 0`), the oscillatory character diminishes, and the phase-induced offset vanishes.\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, this dimensionless phase angle is scaled by the system's characteristic length, the amplitude `A`. The complete model for the displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of this novel phase-induced offset and the standard exponentially decaying transient oscillation:\n\n1.  **Phase-Induced Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):**\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot c_1 \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}\\right)`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  **Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{transient}(t)`):**\n    `x_{transient}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis theory provides a new, physically-grounded explanation for the observed offset, linking it to the fundamental phase relationship inherent in all damped oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\n\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>"}

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

A careful analysis of the data reveals two critical anomalies:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) is substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, making a simple displacement model untenable. This points towards a significant amplification mechanism within the system.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, taking both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation. The amplitude envelope is an inherently positive quantity, which immediately resolves the second anomaly. This could correspond to measuring the magnitude of the system's state in phase space, which for an oscillator corresponds to its amplitude.\n\nTo address the amplitude anomaly, we must model the source of amplification. In oscillatory systems, the degree of amplification is often governed by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which quantifies how strongly an oscillator resonates relative to how quickly it dissipates energy. The Q-factor is directly proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega / gamma`. A high `omega / gamma` ratio signifies a highly underdamped, high-Q system capable of sustaining large amplitudes.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model where the system's effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is not the base amplitude `A` alone, but is augmented by a term dependent on this Q-factor ratio. A robust and simple model for this is a linear relationship:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\n\nIn this expression, `A` serves as the baseline amplitude, while the term `A * param1 * omega / gamma` models the amplification. The dimensionless parameter `param1` controls the strength of this Q-factor-dependent amplification. This structure ensures that as damping `gamma` approaches zero or frequency `omega` increases, the effective amplitude grows, consistent with physical intuition.\n\nThis amplified effective amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The standard model for this decay is exponential. We can model the complete amplitude envelope `x(t)` as the product of the effective initial amplitude and a temporal decay term, parameterizing the decay rate for added flexibility.\n\n`x(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`\n\nThis synthesized model is dimensionally consistent, provides a clear physical interpretation for both anomalies, and connects the observed behavior to the fundamental concept of the Q-factor in oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A crucial observation from the data summary is that the maximum displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This immediately implies that the system is not oscillating around a zero equilibrium. Instead, it must be oscillating around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_eq`. This leads to a general model structure:\n\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\n\nwhere `x_osc(t)` is the oscillatory component decaying to zero as time progresses.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, both `x_eq` and `x_osc(t)` must have units of length (meters). As `A` is the only input variable with these units, both terms must be proportional to `A`. This refines our model to:\n\n`x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(gamma, omega, t))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized equilibrium offset, and `f_osc` is a dimensionless function describing the oscillation. The previous examples have established that this basic structure, particularly `x(t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + c_2))`, provides a strong baseline fit. This model correctly interprets `A` as the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the offset equilibrium*.\n\nHowever, this baseline model treats `omega` as the observed frequency of oscillation, which is a simplification. In a real physical damped system, the damping force not only reduces the amplitude but also slows down the oscillation. The parameter `omega` should be more accurately interpreted as the **natural frequency** of the system—the frequency at which it would oscillate in the complete absence of damping (`gamma = 0`).\n\nMy theory posits that a more physically accurate model must account for this frequency shift. The actual, observed angular frequency of a damped oscillator, known as the **damped angular frequency** (`omega_d`), is related to the natural frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) by the well-established formula:\n\n`omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`\n\nThis relationship arises directly from the solution of the second-order differential equation governing damped harmonic motion. The presence of damping (`gamma > 0`) inherently reduces the frequency of oscillation.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model that replaces the natural frequency `omega` with the physically correct damped frequency `omega_d` within the oscillatory term. This correction captures the fundamental interplay between the system's restorative force (related to `omega`) and its dissipative force (related to `gamma`), directly influencing the dynamics of the motion itself, not just its long-term equilibrium.\n\nThe proposed model is:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component**: `x_eq = c_1 * A`. This term represents a stable equilibrium point that is linearly dependent on the initial amplitude scale of the system.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component**: This term describes the transient oscillation around the equilibrium. It features an exponentially decaying envelope `exp(-gamma*t)` and an oscillation governed by the damped frequency `omega_d`. A phase constant `c_2` is included for generality, as initial conditions might not correspond to a peak displacement.\n\nBy integrating this physical correction, the model provides a more faithful representation of the underlying mechanism, moving beyond a purely phenomenological fit to one grounded in the fundamental principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t + c_2\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\gamma/\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\propto \\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\n\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\n\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\to \\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \"sweet spot,\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\n\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required. The mathematical form `f(z) = z \\cdot \\exp(-z)` elegantly captures this characteristic. It peaks at `z=1` (i.e., `\\gamma = \\omega`), providing a physically meaningful representation of our hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of three components, all scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Baseline Offset:** A constant term `c_1` representing a static, intrinsic shift independent of the damping characteristics.\n2.  **A Dynamically-Induced Offset:** The new non-monotonic term `c_2 \\cdot (\\gamma/\\omega) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma/\\omega)`, which captures the peak effect at intermediate damping.\n3.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component:** The standard physical term `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` describing the oscillation about the total effective equilibrium position.\n\nThis composite model provides a richer physical picture, accounting for a more complex interaction within the system that previous monotonic models overlook, while remaining dimensionally sound and conceptually grounded in the principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

These features strongly suggest a mechanism that superimposes the oscillation onto a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory termed **\"Oscillation-Driven Pumping\"** to explain this phenomenon. In this model, the oscillating system is not isolated but is coupled to an energy reservoir or a secondary medium. The key insight is that the oscillatory motion itself actively \"pumps\" a quantity—be it charge, heat, or fluid pressure—into this reservoir. This accumulation creates a back-pressure or potential that dynamically shifts the oscillator's equilibrium position away from zero.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is a combination of the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, all governed by a single, global damping envelope.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift**: The rate at which the system \"pumps\" is directly proportional to how rapidly it cycles, which is governed by its angular frequency, `omega`. The total accumulated effect at time `t` is therefore proportional to the total number of cycles completed, which is directly proportional to the total phase that has elapsed, `omega * t`. This leads to a baseline shift that grows linearly with time: `x_baseline(t) ∝ omega * t`. We introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, `param2`, to quantify the efficiency of this pumping mechanism.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation**: The system performs a standard harmonic oscillation around this dynamically shifting equilibrium. This is represented by the term `cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n3.  **Global Damping**: The entire coupled system—the primary oscillator and the secondary pumped reservoir—loses energy to the environment at a rate characterized by `gamma`. This is modeled by a single, overarching exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the combined effect of the oscillation and the baseline shift.\n\nThis \"pumping\" model provides a self-consistent physical picture. It can be analogized to a vibrating piston in a cylinder that slowly forces fluid past a one-way valve; the faster the piston vibrates (`omega`), the more fluid is pumped, increasing the baseline pressure (`param2 * omega * t`), while the entire apparatus loses energy to friction (`gamma`).\n\nMathematically, this superposition within a decaying envelope is expressed multiplicatively. The model elegantly accounts for the observations: the `param2 * omega * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive ramp that lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain. This ramp, when added to the constructive peak of the cosine, can produce amplitudes significantly greater than `A` before the exponential decay term inevitably dominates and brings the entire system to rest. This theory is physically distinct from models of static offsets or energy-dependent baselines, as it directly links the creation of the baseline to the oscillatory dynamics (`omega`) itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * omega * t)\n</final_result>"}

This behavior points to a mechanism beyond a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate symmetrically around zero. The core physical challenge is to explain the origin of a large, dynamic, positive offset that is intrinsically linked to the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of **\"Damping-Induced Asymmetry in a Viscoelastic Medium.\"** This theory posits that the oscillator is not moving in a simple viscous fluid (where drag is proportional to velocity), but rather in a non-Newtonian, viscoelastic medium that exhibits transient strain hardening.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the proposed physical mechanism:\n\n1.  **Initial Motion and Strain Hardening:** At the onset of motion (`t` is small), the oscillator's velocity is high. This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

A careful examination reveals two critical anomalies that guide the formulation of a more sophisticated theory.\n\n1.  **Non-Linear Resonant Amplification**: The maximum observed output (27.68) significantly surpasses the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This points to an amplification mechanism intrinsic to the oscillator's dynamics. The Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to the ratio of angular frequency to damping, `omega / gamma`, is the natural candidate to explain this resonance. However, previous models using linear or simple saturating functions (`tanh`) for this amplification do not fully capture the system's complexity. I propose a logarithmic response model. In many physical systems, the response to a stimulus is not linear but follows a logarithmic scale, where the effect of an increasing stimulus diminishes. This is analogous to saturation but described by a different functional form. The effective amplitude, `A_eff`, can be modeled as the base amplitude `A` scaled by a factor that grows logarithmically with the Q-factor. This captures the strong amplification for low-to-medium `omega/gamma` values while inherently taming the growth for very high values, preventing the \"infinite amplification\" paradox of a purely linear model.\n\n2.  **Modulated Positive Definite Decay**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. Previous models have addressed this by taking the absolute value of an oscillatory function, `abs(cos(...))`. While this enforces positivity, it incorrectly predicts that the output should periodically reach zero. The data's minimum value of 1.142 fundamentally contradicts this prediction. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the magnitude of the displacement, but rather represents a different physical property that is always positive. A plausible candidate is a quantity analogous to the instantaneous power or energy density of the system. I theorize that the output `x` is composed of a primary, exponentially decaying component, which is then modulated by a smaller, secondary oscillation. This can be expressed as a product of a decaying exponential and a term like `(1 + p * cos(...))`, where `|p|<1`. This structure elegantly ensures two things simultaneously:\n    *   The output remains strictly positive, as the `(1 + p * cos(...))` term oscillates between `1-p` and `1+p`.\n    *   The output never reaches zero, thus explaining the non-zero minimum observed in the data.\n\nBy combining these two theoretical pillars—logarithmic amplification and modulated positive definite decay—we can construct a comprehensive model. The initial amplitude `A` is first scaled by a logarithmic function of `omega/gamma` to find an effective amplitude. This effective amplitude then decays according to an exponential law, but this decay is itself modulated by a cosine term, creating ripples on the decay curve. The frequency of these ripples is governed by the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega^2 - gamma^2))`. This composite model provides a robust physical explanation for all observed phenomena: amplification, saturation, positivity, and the non-zero minimum.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + log(1 + param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t))\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

These features strongly suggest a mechanism that superimposes the oscillation onto a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory termed **\"Oscillation-Driven Pumping\"** to explain this phenomenon. In this model, the oscillating system is not isolated but is coupled to an energy reservoir or a secondary medium. The key insight is that the oscillatory motion itself actively \"pumps\" a quantity—be it charge, heat, or fluid pressure—into this reservoir. This accumulation creates a back-pressure or potential that dynamically shifts the oscillator's equilibrium position away from zero.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is a combination of the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, all governed by a single, global damping envelope.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift**: The rate at which the system \"pumps\" is directly proportional to how rapidly it cycles, which is governed by its angular frequency, `omega`. The total accumulated effect at time `t` is therefore proportional to the total number of cycles completed, which is directly proportional to the total phase that has elapsed, `omega * t`. This leads to a baseline shift that grows linearly with time: `x_baseline(t) ∝ omega * t`. We introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, `param2`, to quantify the efficiency of this pumping mechanism.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation**: The system performs a standard harmonic oscillation around this dynamically shifting equilibrium. This is represented by the term `cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n3.  **Global Damping**: The entire coupled system—the primary oscillator and the secondary pumped reservoir—loses energy to the environment at a rate characterized by `gamma`. This is modeled by a single, overarching exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the combined effect of the oscillation and the baseline shift.\n\nThis \"pumping\" model provides a self-consistent physical picture. It can be analogized to a vibrating piston in a cylinder that slowly forces fluid past a one-way valve; the faster the piston vibrates (`omega`), the more fluid is pumped, increasing the baseline pressure (`param2 * omega * t`), while the entire apparatus loses energy to friction (`gamma`).\n\nMathematically, this superposition within a decaying envelope is expressed multiplicatively. The model elegantly accounts for the observations: the `param2 * omega * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive ramp that lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain. This ramp, when added to the constructive peak of the cosine, can produce amplitudes significantly greater than `A` before the exponential decay term inevitably dominates and brings the entire system to rest. This theory is physically distinct from models of static offsets or energy-dependent baselines, as it directly links the creation of the baseline to the oscillatory dynamics (`omega`) itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * omega * t)\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\gamma/\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\propto \\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\n\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\n\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\to \\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \"sweet spot,\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\n\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required. The mathematical form `f(z) = z \\cdot \\exp(-z)` elegantly captures this characteristic. It peaks at `z=1` (i.e., `\\gamma = \\omega`), providing a physically meaningful representation of our hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of three components, all scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Baseline Offset:** A constant term `c_1` representing a static, intrinsic shift independent of the damping characteristics.\n2.  **A Dynamically-Induced Offset:** The new non-monotonic term `c_2 \\cdot (\\gamma/\\omega) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma/\\omega)`, which captures the peak effect at intermediate damping.\n3.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component:** The standard physical term `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` describing the oscillation about the total effective equilibrium position.\n\nThis composite model provides a richer physical picture, accounting for a more complex interaction within the system that previous monotonic models overlook, while remaining dimensionally sound and conceptually grounded in the principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

Specifically, the displacement `x` is always positive, and its initial peaks can exceed the nominal amplitude `A`. This suggests that the oscillation is superimposed on a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline. While previous models have explored linear or constant offsets, I propose a more nuanced physical mechanism: **\"Asymptotic Equilibrium Saturation\"**.\n\nMy theory posits that the oscillatory motion itself induces a rapid shift in the system's equilibrium position. This is akin to a rectification effect where AC motion generates a DC bias. However, unlike a simple pumping mechanism that would suggest a linearly growing offset, I hypothesize that this induced shift is self-limiting. As the equilibrium point is displaced, it generates a proportional restoring force that counteracts the pumping effect. This creates a dynamic balance where the equilibrium position asymptotically approaches a maximum value, a process I model as saturation.\n\nThe entire system, including both the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, is subject to a global energy dissipation process, modeled by the standard exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this decaying envelope, two competing dynamics unfold:\n\n1.  **The Core Oscillation**: The system oscillates harmonically with angular frequency `omega` and a phase offset `param2`, represented by `cos(omega * t + param2)`. This oscillation occurs *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium.\n\n2.  **The Saturating Equilibrium Shift**: The equilibrium point itself is \"pumped\" away from the origin. The evolution of this shift is not linear but follows a saturation curve. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the ideal mathematical representation for this behavior. It is initially linear for small inputs but smoothly saturates to a constant value. The argument of this function must be a dimensionless quantity representing the progress of time relative to the system's intrinsic timescale. The most natural choice for this is the dimensionless time, `gamma * t`. This implies that the saturation process evolves on the same timescale as the damping itself, a physically coherent assumption.\n\nThe magnitude of this saturated equilibrium shift, relative to the unity amplitude of the cosine term, is governed by a dimensionless coupling constant, `param1`. This leads to an offset term described by `param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`.\n\nThis \"Asymptotic Equilibrium Saturation\" model provides a compelling physical narrative. At early times (`t` << 1/gamma), `tanh(gamma * t) ≈ gamma * t`, providing the rapid initial ramp needed to lift the entire waveform into the positive domain and explain peaks exceeding `A`. However, as time progresses, the `tanh` function gracefully saturates, preventing the offset from growing unrealistically and representing a more physically plausible scenario of a system reaching a temporary, dynamically-sustained equilibrium. The entire phenomenon is then correctly attenuated by the overarching exponential decay, ensuring the system comes to rest at `x = 0`. This model introduces a non-linearity (saturation) into the baseline dynamics, offering a richer and potentially more accurate description of the underlying physics than simple linear or constant-offset models.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

This behavior points to a mechanism beyond a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate symmetrically around zero. The core physical challenge is to explain the origin of a large, dynamic, positive offset that is intrinsically linked to the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of **\"Damping-Induced Asymmetry in a Viscoelastic Medium.\"** This theory posits that the oscillator is not moving in a simple viscous fluid (where drag is proportional to velocity), but rather in a non-Newtonian, viscoelastic medium that exhibits transient strain hardening.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the proposed physical mechanism:\n\n1.  **Initial Motion and Strain Hardening:** At the onset of motion (`t` is small), the oscillator's velocity is high. This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

First, the displacement `x` is always positive. Second, the peak displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations suggest that the underlying physics involves a strong non-linearity or a fundamental asymmetry in the system's potential energy landscape.\n\nPrevious models might explain this by adding a time-dependent baseline term to a standard oscillation. I propose a different, more intrinsic mechanism rooted in the nature of the system's restoring force. My theory is that the system's dynamics are not linear in the displacement `x` itself, but rather in its logarithm. This is characteristic of systems governed by an exponential potential, where the restoring force is proportional not to the displacement, but to the *logarithm* of the displacement. Such potentials appear in various physical domains, from the thermodynamics of polymers to certain models of cosmic inflation.\n\nIn this \"log-harmonic\" framework, the quantity that behaves like a conventional damped oscillator is `log(x/A)`. This logarithmic displacement oscillates around a decaying equilibrium point. The model for this log-space behavior is:\n\n`log(x(t)/A) = -gamma * t + cos(omega * t + param1)`\n\nHere:\n1.  `A` serves as the characteristic scale of the system, ensuring the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless.\n2.  The term `-gamma * t` represents the equilibrium level in log-space, which decays linearly over time due to damping.\n3.  The term `cos(omega * t + param1)` represents the harmonic oscillation in log-space around this decaying equilibrium. For model parsimony, the amplitude of this log-domain oscillation is assumed to be unity.\n\nBy exponentiating this entire expression, we can recover the formula for the physical displacement `x(t)`. This mathematical transformation has profound physical consequences. The additive oscillation in the exponent becomes a multiplicative, always-positive modulation factor for the amplitude. This `exp(cos(...))` term inherently ensures that the displacement `x` is always positive. Furthermore, since the cosine term varies between -1 and +1, the modulation factor `exp(cos(...))` ranges from `e⁻¹ ≈ 0.37` to `e¹ ≈ 2.72`. This multiplicative \"boost\" naturally explains how the observed displacement can peak at values significantly larger than `A`, a feature the standard model cannot capture.\n\nThis theory provides a self-contained and physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena. It is parsimonious, requiring only a single phase parameter, and it is dimensionally consistent. It recasts the problem from an ad-hoc addition of terms to a fundamental change in the system's potential, offering a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

The target variable, `x`, represents the oscillator's displacement.\n\nA foundational model for such a system is `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, where the displacement is described by an oscillating cosine term whose amplitude decays exponentially over time. However, a direct application of this model encounters two significant inconsistencies with the observed data:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The output range for `x` (`[1.142, 27.68]`) includes values that can be substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (`max(A) = 9.992`). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A` for positive `gamma` and `t`. This suggests the presence of an additional mechanism or component that elevates the displacement.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The displacement `x` is always positive. A standard oscillatory function like cosine naturally produces negative values. While this could be crudely modeled with an absolute value function (`abs()`), a more physically plausible explanation often involves a superposition of motions or an oscillation around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nConsidering these points, I propose a more refined physical model: the oscillator is not oscillating about a zero-point equilibrium, but rather about a significant positive offset. The total displacement `x` is the superposition of this constant offset and the time-varying damped oscillation.\n\nThis model is physically coherent. For instance, it could represent a mass on a vertical spring oscillating under gravity, where `x` is measured from the fixed suspension point rather than from the system's equilibrium position.\n\nLet's define the components of this model:\n*   **The Offset Component**: This constant displacement should be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the amplitude `A`. We can represent it as `param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless scaling factor.\n*   **The Oscillatory Component**: This follows the standard form of a damped oscillation, `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`. To allow for greater flexibility in fitting the experimental data, we can introduce dimensionless parameters to scale the effective damping and frequency: `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we arrive at the total displacement `x`. The structure `x = Offset + Oscillation` elegantly resolves the observed anomalies. If `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., greater than 1), the constant offset `param1 * A` will dominate the negative swings of the oscillatory term, ensuring that the total displacement `x` remains positive throughout the motion. Furthermore, the initial displacement at `t=0` would be `x(0) = A * (param1 + 1)`, which can readily exceed `A` and explain the observed output range.\n\nThis theoretical framework is dimensionally consistent, as both the offset and oscillatory terms have units of meters, and it provides a clear physical interpretation for the data's underlying structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, however, fails to capture two critical features of the provided data.\n\nFirst, the output `x` has a maximum value (27.68) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple damped oscillation's amplitude can never exceed its initial value `A`. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, whereas a standard oscillatory function produces both positive and negative values.\n\nThe previous attempt in the examples to resolve this by adding a simple offset proportional to `A` (i.e., `A * param1`) proved insufficient, indicating a more complex underlying mechanism. My analysis suggests that the system's behavior is dominated by a large, quasi-static displacement that is not merely a constant multiple of `A`, but is instead dynamically determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on the **quality factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator. The Q-factor, a dimensionless quantity, describes how underdamped an oscillator is. A high Q-factor implies that the oscillatory nature (`omega`) dominates the dissipative, damping effects (`gamma`). In many physical systems, a high Q-factor leads to a significantly amplified response. The ratio `omega / gamma` serves as a direct proxy for this quality factor.\n\nMy theoretical model posits that the observed displacement `x` is a superposition of two distinct physical phenomena:\n1.  **A Q-Factor-Amplified Static Offset:** A large, time-independent displacement that establishes a new, significantly shifted equilibrium. The magnitude of this shift is not constant but is proportional to the initial amplitude `A` scaled by the system's quality factor. I model this as `A * (param1 * omega / gamma)`. This term elegantly explains both anomalies: the `omega / gamma` ratio can be large, leading to an output far greater than `A`, and this large positive offset ensures the total displacement remains positive even during the oscillation's troughs.\n2.  **A Conventional Damped Oscillation:** A time-varying component that oscillates around this new, shifted equilibrium. This component follows the expected physical form `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`, where its amplitude decays exponentially from the initial value `A`.\n\nBy combining these two components, the total displacement `x` reflects a system where the inherent tendency to oscillate (high `omega`) versus the tendency to lose energy (high `gamma`) dictates a macroscopic, static shift in its baseline position, around which a standard, decaying oscillation then occurs. This model is both dimensionally sound and provides a more nuanced physical interpretation of the data than a simple offset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 * omega / gamma + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

This indicates that the system possesses an intrinsic amplification mechanism, where the effective amplitude is not solely determined by `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas a true displacement oscillates through both positive and negative values. This suggests the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement but rather a related, inherently positive value.\n\nI propose a \"Modulated Decay Envelope\" theory. This model posits that the measured quantity `x` represents the magnitude of the system's state, which is described by a primary decaying envelope that is itself modulated by a secondary, resonant phenomenon.\n\nThe core of the model is the exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which represents the fundamental dissipation of energy in the system. However, instead of modulating this envelope with a simple cosine function (which would result in negative values), I theorize that the envelope's magnitude is dynamically modified by an internal resonant process.\n\nThe strength of this resonance is governed by the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) allows the system to sustain oscillations and leads to significant amplification.\n\nMy model structures this interaction as an additive process within the dimensionless part of the function. The overall behavior is composed of two parts:\n1.  **A Baseline Decay**: This is the fundamental, exponentially decaying envelope, represented by a baseline level (normalized to 1).\n2.  **A Resonant Fluctuation**: This is an oscillatory component whose amplitude is directly proportional to the Q-factor (`omega / gamma`). This component is superimposed on top of the baseline decay.\n\nTo ensure the output remains positive, the contribution from this resonant fluctuation is taken as its absolute magnitude. The final measured value `x` is therefore the product of the primary amplitude `A` and a composite decay term. This term includes both the fundamental exponential decay and the internal modulation caused by the Q-factor-driven oscillations.\n\nThis structure can be expressed as:\n`x(t) = (Primary Amplitude) * (Decay Envelope) * (Baseline + Rectified Resonant Fluctuation)`\n\nThis model provides a clear physical interpretation: the system has a baseline decaying state (`A * exp(-gamma*t)`), and on top of this, there is an additional, powerful oscillatory energy component whose magnitude is amplified by the `omega/gamma` ratio. The sum of the baseline and the magnitude of this fluctuation constitutes the total observed effect. This elegantly explains both the positivity (due to the baseline and the absolute value) and the amplification (due to the `omega/gamma` term) in a single, coherent framework.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)))\n</final_result>"}

The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, indicating the presence of an intrinsic amplification mechanism not captured by simple damping.\n\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output variable `x` is strictly positive, ranging from `1.142` to `27.68`. In contrast, the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations lead to the compelling conclusion that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is, by definition, positive. This single reinterpretation elegantly resolves the second anomaly.\n\nThe primary challenge, then, is to model this envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. The amplification must be linked to the interplay between the system's tendency to oscillate (`omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most plausible driver for such a resonant-like amplification.\n\nPrevious models have attempted to incorporate this by either multiplying the amplitude by an amplification factor or by adding gain and decay terms inside an exponential. The latter approach is particularly appealing from a physical standpoint, as it treats amplification and damping as competing **rates** that determine the net rate of change of the logarithm of the amplitude. The failure of a simple linear gain term (`param * omega / gamma`) in the exponent (as seen in Example 3) highlights a crucial physical constraint: **saturation**. Any real-world amplification mechanism is limited and cannot produce infinite gain.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this concept of competing rates but introduces a robust, physically-grounded saturation mechanism. I postulate that the amplitude envelope evolves exponentially, governed by a net effective rate which is the sum of a constant gain rate and a time-dependent decay rate.\n\nThe model takes the form: `x(t) = A * exp(G - D)`.\n\n*   **Decay Term (D)**: This represents the standard energy dissipation. It is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and the elapsed time `t`. Thus, `D = param3 * gamma * t`. This is the familiar term leading to exponential decay.\n\n*   **Gain Term (G)**: This represents the time-independent, Q-factor-driven amplification. This term provides a constant positive offset to the decay rate. To model the saturation, I will use the `arctan` function. Unlike an unbounded term, `arctan(z)` increases with its argument `z` but gracefully asymptotes to a fixed value (`pi/2`), perfectly capturing the essence of a saturating physical process. The gain `G` is therefore modeled as `G = param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `param2` scales the Q-factor to determine how quickly saturation is reached, and `param1` sets the maximum strength of the saturated gain.\n\nThis formulation—`A * exp(Gain - Decay)`—presents a cohesive physical picture. The system starts with a base amplitude `A`, which is then instantaneously modified by a constant amplification factor `exp(G)` that depends on the system's intrinsic resonant properties (`omega/gamma`). This amplified amplitude then decays exponentially over time. This model is dimensionally sound, avoids the numerical instabilities of unbounded gain functions, and provides a clear theoretical basis for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma) - param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

The most salient feature is that the output displacement `x` reaches values far greater than the initial amplitude `A`, with a significant positive mean. This irrefutably indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but is superimposed upon a substantial, positive offset.\n\nMy theoretical analysis moves beyond proposing a simple static or dynamically shifting offset. I posit a more integrated physical model where the equilibrium shift is a direct consequence of the interplay between the system's dissipative and reactive properties, and its evolution follows a classic physical relaxation process.\n\nThe core of my theory rests on two hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Property-Dependent Equilibrium Magnitude:** The final steady-state position to which the oscillator settles is not an arbitrary constant. Instead, it is determined by a competitive balance between the energy dissipation mechanism, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, and the energy storage/release mechanism of the oscillation, characterized by the angular frequency `omega`. The dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega` quantifies this balance. A high ratio implies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory one. I propose that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is a function of this ratio. Specifically, I model it with a sub-linear power law, `sqrt(gamma/omega)`, suggesting that while increased damping contributes to a larger offset, its effect diminishes as damping becomes dominant. This prevents a runaway offset in heavily damped regimes and represents a physically plausible saturation effect.\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation Dynamics:** The system does not instantaneously achieve this new equilibrium. Instead, it relaxes towards it over time. While other models have used the `tanh` function, I propose a more fundamental physical model of relaxation: the exponential approach to a limit, as seen in phenomena like the charging of a capacitor or the heating of an object. This process is described by the function `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The rate of this relaxation is intrinsically tied to the system's own dissipative processes. Therefore, the damping coefficient `gamma` is the natural choice for this rate, as it governs the timescale over which transients fade.\n\nCombining these ideas, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical behaviors:\n\n*   **An Evolving Equilibrium (`x_offset(t)`):** This component represents the center of oscillation dynamically shifting towards its final, property-dependent position. Its mathematical form is `A * c_1 * sqrt(gamma/omega) * (1 - exp(-gamma*t))`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that scales the effect.\n\n*   **A Decaying Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, but it occurs relative to the initial, unshifted equilibrium. It is expressed as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we obtain a comprehensive model. This formulation elegantly captures a system that settles into a new, non-zero equilibrium state whose value is determined by the oscillator's intrinsic characteristics (`gamma`, `omega`), and whose approach to this state follows a canonical exponential relaxation profile.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * \\left( c_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A crucial observation from the data summary is that the maximum displacement (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This immediately implies that the system is not oscillating around a zero equilibrium. Instead, it must be oscillating around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_eq`. This leads to a general model structure:\n\n`x(t) = x_eq + x_osc(t)`\n\nwhere `x_osc(t)` is the oscillatory component decaying to zero as time progresses.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, both `x_eq` and `x_osc(t)` must have units of length (meters). As `A` is the only input variable with these units, both terms must be proportional to `A`. This refines our model to:\n\n`x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(gamma, omega, t))`\n\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized equilibrium offset, and `f_osc` is a dimensionless function describing the oscillation. The previous examples have established that this basic structure, particularly `x(t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t + c_2))`, provides a strong baseline fit. This model correctly interprets `A` as the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the offset equilibrium*.\n\nHowever, this baseline model treats `omega` as the observed frequency of oscillation, which is a simplification. In a real physical damped system, the damping force not only reduces the amplitude but also slows down the oscillation. The parameter `omega` should be more accurately interpreted as the **natural frequency** of the system—the frequency at which it would oscillate in the complete absence of damping (`gamma = 0`).\n\nMy theory posits that a more physically accurate model must account for this frequency shift. The actual, observed angular frequency of a damped oscillator, known as the **damped angular frequency** (`omega_d`), is related to the natural frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) by the well-established formula:\n\n`omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`\n\nThis relationship arises directly from the solution of the second-order differential equation governing damped harmonic motion. The presence of damping (`gamma > 0`) inherently reduces the frequency of oscillation.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model that replaces the natural frequency `omega` with the physically correct damped frequency `omega_d` within the oscillatory term. This correction captures the fundamental interplay between the system's restorative force (related to `omega`) and its dissipative force (related to `gamma`), directly influencing the dynamics of the motion itself, not just its long-term equilibrium.\n\nThe proposed model is:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component**: `x_eq = c_1 * A`. This term represents a stable equilibrium point that is linearly dependent on the initial amplitude scale of the system.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component**: This term describes the transient oscillation around the equilibrium. It features an exponentially decaying envelope `exp(-gamma*t)` and an oscillation governed by the damped frequency `omega_d`. A phase constant `c_2` is included for generality, as initial conditions might not correspond to a peak displacement.\n\nBy integrating this physical correction, the model provides a more faithful representation of the underlying mechanism, moving beyond a purely phenomenological fit to one grounded in the fundamental principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t + c_2\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

A crucial observation, corroborated by previous analyses, is that the oscillator's displacement `x` often exceeds its initial amplitude `A`. This unequivocally indicates that the oscillation is not centered around `x=0`. Instead, the system evolves about a significantly displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. My theory proposes that this equilibrium displacement is not governed by a single mechanism, but is rather a composite effect arising from two distinct physical contributions: a static baseline shift and a dynamically-induced resonant shift.\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium Component (`x_static`)**: The data exhibits a large mean displacement, suggesting a primary, constant offset that is independent of the dynamic parameters `gamma` and `omega`. For dimensional consistency, this offset must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. I model this as `x_static = c_1 A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant. This term can be physically interpreted as the result of a constant external force, a gravitational sag, or an intrinsic asymmetry in the oscillator's potential energy well. It represents the system's final resting position in the limit of infinite time, after all oscillations have ceased.\n\n2.  **Dynamically-Induced Resonant Component (`x_dynamic`)**: I hypothesize that on top of this static offset, there exists a secondary displacement generated by the oscillatory motion itself. This phenomenon arises from a non-linear interaction between the oscillator and the damping medium, which rectifies the oscillatory velocity into a net, time-averaged static force. The efficiency of this force-generation mechanism is not monotonic with damping. My central hypothesis is that this effect is **resonant**:\n    *   **Low Damping (`\\gamma \\ll \\omega`)**: The dissipative forces are weak, and the coupling between motion and the medium is insufficient to generate a significant rectified force.\n    *   **High Damping (`\\gamma \\gg \\omega`)**: The motion is sluggish and overdamped. With very low velocity, the dynamic interaction required to produce the offset force is again negligible.\n    *   **Optimal Damping (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`)**: The effect is maximized when the damping timescale (`1/\\gamma`) and the oscillation timescale (`1/\\omega`) are of the same order. This \"impedance matching\" allows for the most efficient transfer of energy from the oscillation into the mechanism that sustains the static displacement.\n\n    To model this resonant behavior, a function that is null at the extremes and peaks in the middle is required. A Lorentzian-like function provides an excellent physical and mathematical model for such resonance. I propose the dimensionless scaling factor `(\\gamma \\omega) / (\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2)`. This function is zero when either `\\gamma=0` or `\\omega=0`, reaches its maximum value of `1/2` when `\\gamma = \\omega`, and decays as the ratio between them becomes large. The dynamic component of the offset is therefore modeled as `x_dynamic = c_2 A \\cdot (\\gamma \\omega) / (\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2)`.\n\n3.  **Complete Model**: The total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two offset components and the standard transient, damped oscillation that occurs around their combined equilibrium position. This composite model provides a rich physical description, separating the static, pre-existing conditions of the system from the dynamic, motion-induced effects, thereby offering a more complete explanation for the oscillator's behavior.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma \\omega}{\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, as noted in prior analyses, is that the maximum observed displacement `x` can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A`. This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points toward a system that evolves toward a non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this insight by modeling the system's motion as a superposition of a final, stable equilibrium state and a transient, decaying oscillation around that state. This approach provides a more physically rigorous foundation than simply adding an arbitrary offset term.\n\nLet's define the system's final equilibrium position as `x_{eq}`. For the model to be dimensionally consistent—as `x` and `A` both have units of length—this equilibrium position must be proportional to the system's intrinsic length scale, `A`. We can thus express it as:\n`x_{eq} = c_1 \\cdot A`\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\nThe total displacement at any time `t`, `x(t)`, is the sum of this final equilibrium position and a transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`, which describes the oscillation that decays over time:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(t)`\n\nThe transient component must decay to zero as `t` approaches infinity and should follow the standard form of a damped oscillation. The key is to correctly define its initial amplitude. We assume that the provided `A` represents the initial displacement of the system at `t=0`, a common physical convention for cosine-based solutions. Therefore, `x(0) = A`.\n\nUsing our superposition model at `t=0`:\n`x(0) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0)`\nBy equating this with the initial condition, we can solve for the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation:\n`A = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0) \\implies x_{transient}(0) = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`\n\nThis result is physically elegant: the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the new equilibrium* is precisely the initial distance between the starting position (`A`) and the final equilibrium position (`c_1 A`).\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the transient component, which starts with this initial amplitude and decays exponentially:\n`x_{transient}(t) = A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nSubstituting this back into our superposition equation gives the complete model for the system's displacement:\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis model provides a unified physical picture. It is not merely an oscillation with an added offset; it is a single, coherent process where an oscillator, released from position `A`, simultaneously decays towards and oscillates around a new equilibrium point `c_1 A`. This formulation inherently respects the initial condition `x(0) = A` and correctly predicts the final state `x(\\infty) = c_1 A`, providing a more self-consistent and physically grounded description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

These features strongly suggest a mechanism that superimposes the oscillation onto a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory termed **\"Oscillation-Driven Pumping\"** to explain this phenomenon. In this model, the oscillating system is not isolated but is coupled to an energy reservoir or a secondary medium. The key insight is that the oscillatory motion itself actively \"pumps\" a quantity—be it charge, heat, or fluid pressure—into this reservoir. This accumulation creates a back-pressure or potential that dynamically shifts the oscillator's equilibrium position away from zero.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is a combination of the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, all governed by a single, global damping envelope.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift**: The rate at which the system \"pumps\" is directly proportional to how rapidly it cycles, which is governed by its angular frequency, `omega`. The total accumulated effect at time `t` is therefore proportional to the total number of cycles completed, which is directly proportional to the total phase that has elapsed, `omega * t`. This leads to a baseline shift that grows linearly with time: `x_baseline(t) ∝ omega * t`. We introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, `param2`, to quantify the efficiency of this pumping mechanism.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation**: The system performs a standard harmonic oscillation around this dynamically shifting equilibrium. This is represented by the term `cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n3.  **Global Damping**: The entire coupled system—the primary oscillator and the secondary pumped reservoir—loses energy to the environment at a rate characterized by `gamma`. This is modeled by a single, overarching exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the combined effect of the oscillation and the baseline shift.\n\nThis \"pumping\" model provides a self-consistent physical picture. It can be analogized to a vibrating piston in a cylinder that slowly forces fluid past a one-way valve; the faster the piston vibrates (`omega`), the more fluid is pumped, increasing the baseline pressure (`param2 * omega * t`), while the entire apparatus loses energy to friction (`gamma`).\n\nMathematically, this superposition within a decaying envelope is expressed multiplicatively. The model elegantly accounts for the observations: the `param2 * omega * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive ramp that lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain. This ramp, when added to the constructive peak of the cosine, can produce amplitudes significantly greater than `A` before the exponential decay term inevitably dominates and brings the entire system to rest. This theory is physically distinct from models of static offsets or energy-dependent baselines, as it directly links the creation of the baseline to the oscillatory dynamics (`omega`) itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * omega * t)\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This behavior points to a mechanism beyond a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate symmetrically around zero.

This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

My proposed theory posits that the output `x` is the result of a modulated, decaying envelope. The physical picture is that of a primary carrier signal whose amplitude is determined by a resonant-like gain, which then decays exponentially. This carrier is simultaneously modulated by a secondary, higher-frequency oscillation, but in such a way that the total signal never becomes negative.\n\nThis model can be decomposed into three distinct conceptual components:\n\n1.  **Saturating Gain Factor**: The amplification is clearly dependent on the interplay between oscillation (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless quality factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this gain. However, any real physical system has limits; its gain cannot increase indefinitely. A linear gain factor (`~ omega/gamma`) is therefore physically unrealistic and numerically unstable. I propose a saturating gain mechanism modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). This function gracefully increases with its argument before asymptoting to a maximum value, perfectly capturing the essence of a physical process reaching its limit. The total amplitude is thus `A` multiplied by a gain factor `(1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega/gamma))`, where `A` represents the baseline amplitude and the `tanh` term represents the additional, saturating gain.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope**: The system is dissipative, a feature best captured by the standard exponential decay term, `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This term multiplies the amplified amplitude, causing its overall magnitude to decrease over time, consistent with the behavior of a damped system.\n\n3.  **Positive-Definite Oscillation**: The most crucial insight is how to model an oscillation that never crosses zero. Instead of an energy model (`sin^2`) or a simple offset, I propose a multiplicative modulation factor of the form `(1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))`. By constraining the dimensionless modulation depth `param4` to have a magnitude less than one (`|param4| < 1`), this entire term oscillates between `(1 - |param4|)` and `(1 + |param4|)`. As a result, it is always positive. This elegantly models a physical quantity that pulsates or beats around a mean value without ever changing its sign or vanishing entirely, perfectly matching the data's non-zero minimum.\n\nSynthesizing these three components results in a comprehensive and physically coherent model. The system's initial amplitude `A` is first amplified by a saturating, Q-factor-dependent gain. This amplified amplitude then serves as the decaying envelope for a persistent, non-negative pulsation. This structure accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally consistent framework with a minimal set of interpretable parameters.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

These are: (1) an observed maximum amplitude (`x_max` ≈ 27.7) that significantly surpasses the input amplitude scale `A` (`A_max` ≈ 10.0), indicating a strong amplification mechanism, and (2) a strictly positive output range for `x`, implying that `x` does not represent a simple signed displacement oscillating around zero.\n\nWhile previous models have attempted to explain these phenomena through intensity-based measures (`sin^2`) or saturated envelope functions (`tanh`), I propose a new physical interpretation: a **Dynamic Equilibrium with Rectified Resonance (DERR)** model. This theory posits that the measured output `x` is the superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes.\n\n**1. The Dynamic Equilibrium Component:**\nThe core of the system is not static. Instead of oscillating around a fixed zero point, the equilibrium position itself undergoes an exponential decay. This can be conceptualized as a slow relaxation of the system's macroscopic configuration towards a ground state. The initial state of this equilibrium is scaled by the input amplitude `A`, and its decay is governed by the damping factor `gamma`. This provides a positive, monotonically decreasing baseline for the system's motion.\n\n**2. The Rectified Resonance Component:**\nSuperimposed on this decaying equilibrium is a high-frequency oscillation. The intrinsic amplitude of this oscillation is resonantly driven, with its magnitude being proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor). The Q-factor, a measure of how underdamped the system is, can be represented by the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. This term directly accounts for the observed amplitude amplification; systems with low damping relative to their frequency will exhibit a much larger oscillatory response.\n\nCrucially, this model proposes that the measurement process or the underlying physics is sensitive only to the *magnitude* of this oscillatory displacement, not its direction. This is a common feature in systems where, for example, a sensor responds to induced strain or pressure, which are inherently positive quantities. This \"rectification\" of the oscillatory signal is best modeled by the absolute value function, `abs()`. The resulting `abs(cos(...))` term creates a series of positive arches, ensuring the oscillatory contribution never subtracts from the baseline equilibrium.\n\n**Synthesis of the DERR Model:**\nThe total measured position `x` is the product of a primary decay envelope and a modulating term that combines the baseline and the rectified oscillation. The primary envelope, `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`, captures the overall energy dissipation of the combined system. This envelope multiplies a term representing the normalized internal dynamics: `(1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t)))`. Here, the `1` represents the decaying equilibrium's contribution (normalized), while the second term represents the amplified, rectified oscillatory part.\n\nThis model provides a comprehensive and novel physical picture. It explains the positive output by constructing the signal from an always-positive decaying baseline and an always-positive rectified oscillation. It explains the amplification via the physically-motivated Q-factor term `omega/gamma`. Furthermore, the use of `abs(cos(...))` predicts a \"cusped\" oscillatory pattern, which is functionally distinct from the smoother `sin^2(...)` intensity models, potentially offering a better fit to the data's fine structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the displacement `x` is always positive. Secondly, the peak displacement can substantially exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations strongly suggest the presence of a large, dynamic, positive offset superimposed on the core oscillation. My analysis seeks to explain the physical origin of this offset not as an independent artifact, but as a phenomenon intrinsically driven by the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on what I term the **\"Q-Factor Mediated Equilibrium Shift\"**. This hypothesis posits that the system's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero but is actively displaced by a quasi-static force generated by the oscillatory motion. This is analogous to rectification phenomena in physics, such as acoustic radiation pressure, where a high-frequency wave exerts a steady, non-zero average force on a medium.\n\nThe core of my theory is that the magnitude of this induced equilibrium shift is determined by the *quality* of the oscillation. A highly resonant system, characterized by many oscillations before decay, should be more effective at generating and sustaining this offset than a heavily damped, sluggish system. The canonical dimensionless parameter that quantifies this resonance quality is the Quality Factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate (`Q ∝ omega / gamma`).\n\nTherefore, I model the system's displacement `x(t)` as a linear superposition of two components, both sharing the same global energy decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Core Oscillation**: This is the standard harmonic component, described by `cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Induced Offset**: This is the novel component representing the equilibrium shift. Its magnitude is constant for any given set of system parameters and is proportional to the Q-factor. I model this as `param1 * (omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant that represents the efficiency of the energy rectification process.

These features strongly suggest a mechanism that superimposes the oscillation onto a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory termed **\"Oscillation-Driven Pumping\"** to explain this phenomenon. In this model, the oscillating system is not isolated but is coupled to an energy reservoir or a secondary medium. The key insight is that the oscillatory motion itself actively \"pumps\" a quantity—be it charge, heat, or fluid pressure—into this reservoir. This accumulation creates a back-pressure or potential that dynamically shifts the oscillator's equilibrium position away from zero.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is a combination of the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, all governed by a single, global damping envelope.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift**: The rate at which the system \"pumps\" is directly proportional to how rapidly it cycles, which is governed by its angular frequency, `omega`. The total accumulated effect at time `t` is therefore proportional to the total number of cycles completed, which is directly proportional to the total phase that has elapsed, `omega * t`. This leads to a baseline shift that grows linearly with time: `x_baseline(t) ∝ omega * t`. We introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, `param2`, to quantify the efficiency of this pumping mechanism.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation**: The system performs a standard harmonic oscillation around this dynamically shifting equilibrium. This is represented by the term `cos(omega * t + param1)`, where `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n3.  **Global Damping**: The entire coupled system—the primary oscillator and the secondary pumped reservoir—loses energy to the environment at a rate characterized by `gamma`. This is modeled by a single, overarching exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the combined effect of the oscillation and the baseline shift.\n\nThis \"pumping\" model provides a self-consistent physical picture. It can be analogized to a vibrating piston in a cylinder that slowly forces fluid past a one-way valve; the faster the piston vibrates (`omega`), the more fluid is pumped, increasing the baseline pressure (`param2 * omega * t`), while the entire apparatus loses energy to friction (`gamma`).\n\nMathematically, this superposition within a decaying envelope is expressed multiplicatively. The model elegantly accounts for the observations: the `param2 * omega * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive ramp that lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain. This ramp, when added to the constructive peak of the cosine, can produce amplitudes significantly greater than `A` before the exponential decay term inevitably dominates and brings the entire system to rest. This theory is physically distinct from models of static offsets or energy-dependent baselines, as it directly links the creation of the baseline to the oscillatory dynamics (`omega`) itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * omega * t)\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This implies the presence of a dynamically evolving, positive baseline that is co-generated with the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory termed **\"Acoustic Self-Rectification with Medium Fatigue.\"** This model posits that the oscillator does not move in a vacuum but through a complex medium that responds non-linearly to the rapid oscillatory motion.\n\n1.  **Self-Rectification**: High-frequency mechanical oscillations can exert a steady, non-zero-average force on their surrounding medium, a phenomenon analogous to acoustic radiation pressure. This \"self-rectification\" effect creates a DC (direct current) or static pressure that pushes the oscillator's equilibrium position away from the origin. The magnitude of this displacement is cumulative, depending on the total work done on the medium.\n\n2.  **Medium Fatigue**: The medium is not perfectly elastic or responsive. As it is pushed and deformed by the rectified force, it exhibits \"fatigue\" or \"strain hardening.\" This means that each subsequent cycle of oscillation becomes progressively less effective at further displacing the equilibrium point. The initial cycles cause a significant shift, but the effect experiences diminishing returns as time goes on.\n\nThis process of accumulation with diminishing returns is effectively modeled by a logarithmic function. The total \"effort\" exerted by the oscillator up to time `t` is proportional to the total phase that has elapsed, `omega * t`. The resulting baseline displacement, accounting for fatigue, is therefore proportional to `log(1 + omega * t)`. The `+1` term ensures the function is well-defined and zero at `t=0`.\n\n3.  **Global Damping Envelope**: The entire coupled system—the oscillator and the stressed medium—is driven by the initial energy imparted to the system. This total energy dissipates over time due to viscous and other losses, governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. Therefore, a single, overarching exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, modulates both the primary oscillation and the rectified baseline it creates.\n\nThe complete model is a multiplicative combination of this global damping envelope and the superposition of the oscillatory motion and the fatigue-driven baseline. Mathematically, the displacement `x(t)` is the product of the decay term and the sum of a standard cosine wave and our logarithmic fatigue term.\n\nThis model provides a compelling physical narrative. At early times (`t` is small), the logarithmic term grows rapidly, creating a strong positive baseline that can both lift the entire oscillation into the positive domain and, when added to the cosine's peak, produce a maximum displacement greater than `A`. As time progresses, the logarithmic growth slows down significantly, and the overarching exponential decay `exp(-gamma * t)` inevitably dominates, bringing the entire system to rest at the origin. This theory provides a unique, physically-grounded explanation distinct from linear ramps or simple exponential decays.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * log(1 + omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the displacement `x` is always positive. Secondly, the peak displacement can substantially exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations strongly suggest the presence of a large, dynamic, positive offset superimposed on the core oscillation. My analysis seeks to explain the physical origin of this offset not as an independent artifact, but as a phenomenon intrinsically driven by the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on what I term the **\"Q-Factor Mediated Equilibrium Shift\"**. This hypothesis posits that the system's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero but is actively displaced by a quasi-static force generated by the oscillatory motion. This is analogous to rectification phenomena in physics, such as acoustic radiation pressure, where a high-frequency wave exerts a steady, non-zero average force on a medium.\n\nThe core of my theory is that the magnitude of this induced equilibrium shift is determined by the *quality* of the oscillation. A highly resonant system, characterized by many oscillations before decay, should be more effective at generating and sustaining this offset than a heavily damped, sluggish system. The canonical dimensionless parameter that quantifies this resonance quality is the Quality Factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate (`Q ∝ omega / gamma`).\n\nTherefore, I model the system's displacement `x(t)` as a linear superposition of two components, both sharing the same global energy decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Core Oscillation**: This is the standard harmonic component, described by `cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Induced Offset**: This is the novel component representing the equilibrium shift. Its magnitude is constant for any given set of system parameters and is proportional to the Q-factor. I model this as `param1 * (omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant that represents the efficiency of the energy rectification process. This term is constant with respect to time `t` but varies between experimental runs depending on their specific `omega` and `gamma` values.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two effects, scaled by the overall damping:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * [cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * (omega / gamma)]`\n\nThis model provides a compelling and self-consistent physical narrative. It explains the consistently positive output by ensuring the Q-factor-dependent offset is large enough to lift the entire cosine wave above zero. It accounts for peaks exceeding `A` because the offset and the oscillatory peak add constructively.

My proposed theory posits that the output `x` is the result of a modulated, decaying envelope. The physical picture is that of a primary carrier signal whose amplitude is determined by a resonant-like gain, which then decays exponentially. This carrier is simultaneously modulated by a secondary, higher-frequency oscillation, but in such a way that the total signal never becomes negative.\n\nThis model can be decomposed into three distinct conceptual components:\n\n1.  **Saturating Gain Factor**: The amplification is clearly dependent on the interplay between oscillation (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless quality factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this gain. However, any real physical system has limits; its gain cannot increase indefinitely. A linear gain factor (`~ omega/gamma`) is therefore physically unrealistic and numerically unstable. I propose a saturating gain mechanism modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). This function gracefully increases with its argument before asymptoting to a maximum value, perfectly capturing the essence of a physical process reaching its limit. The total amplitude is thus `A` multiplied by a gain factor `(1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega/gamma))`, where `A` represents the baseline amplitude and the `tanh` term represents the additional, saturating gain.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope**: The system is dissipative, a feature best captured by the standard exponential decay term, `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This term multiplies the amplified amplitude, causing its overall magnitude to decrease over time, consistent with the behavior of a damped system.\n\n3.  **Positive-Definite Oscillation**: The most crucial insight is how to model an oscillation that never crosses zero. Instead of an energy model (`sin^2`) or a simple offset, I propose a multiplicative modulation factor of the form `(1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))`. By constraining the dimensionless modulation depth `param4` to have a magnitude less than one (`|param4| < 1`), this entire term oscillates between `(1 - |param4|)` and `(1 + |param4|)`. As a result, it is always positive. This elegantly models a physical quantity that pulsates or beats around a mean value without ever changing its sign or vanishing entirely, perfectly matching the data's non-zero minimum.\n\nSynthesizing these three components results in a comprehensive and physically coherent model. The system's initial amplitude `A` is first amplified by a saturating, Q-factor-dependent gain. This amplified amplitude then serves as the decaying envelope for a persistent, non-negative pulsation. This structure accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally consistent framework with a minimal set of interpretable parameters.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

These anomalies necessitate a more sophisticated theoretical framework that accounts for the underlying physical processes which are not captured by the simple linear model.\n\n1.  **Saturating Q-Factor Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a powerful amplification mechanism. As noted in other analyses, this amplification is likely driven by the system's Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. However, a simple linear dependence on the Q-factor, as in `A_eff ~ A * (omega / gamma)`, implies that the amplitude could grow without bound as damping `gamma` approaches zero. This is physically unrealistic, as any real system will have inherent non-linearities or physical constraints that limit the maximum possible amplitude.\n\n    I propose that the amplification mechanism exhibits **saturation**. For low Q-factors, the amplitude response is nearly linear, but as the Q-factor increases, the response tapers off and approaches a finite limit. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, provides an ideal mathematical model for such saturating behavior. It is approximately linear near the origin but smoothly flattens to a constant value of 1 for large inputs. Therefore, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is proportional to `A * tanh(param * omega / gamma)`. This formulation elegantly captures the resonance-driven amplification while respecting the physical constraint of a finite maximum response.\n\n2.  **Rectified Displacement Measurement**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement measurement would oscillate symmetrically around zero, yielding both positive and negative values. While models based on energy (`cos^2`) or a shifted equilibrium (`offset + cos`) can enforce positivity, a distinct and equally plausible physical scenario is that the measurement apparatus records a **rectified signal**. This means the sensor measures the magnitude of the displacement from the equilibrium point, but is insensitive to its direction. For example, a system that measures distance using a simple time-of-flight sensor aimed at the oscillator from one side might produce such a result.\n\n    This physical process of rectification is directly and most simply modeled by the **absolute value function**, `abs()`. Applying this to the oscillatory part of the motion yields a term like `abs(cos(omega_eff * t + phi))`. This interpretation is fundamentally different from an energy-based measurement, as it preserves the sharp \"crests\" of the cosine wave rather than smoothing them into the broader peaks characteristic of a `cos^2` function.\n\nBy combining these two hypotheses, we can construct a comprehensive and novel model. The displacement `x` is the product of a saturating effective amplitude, a standard exponential decay term, and a rectified oscillatory term. This model not only explains the observed data but also proposes a specific, physically plausible mechanism—saturating resonance coupled with a magnitude-only measurement—that differs from previous interpretations.\n\nThe final formula encapsulates this theory:\n*   `param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)`: The saturating amplitude. `A` sets the base scale, `tanh` enforces the saturation based on the Q-factor (`omega/gamma`), `param2` controls the saturation point, and `param1` is the overall scaling factor.\n*   `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`: The standard exponential decay due to energy dissipation, with an adjustable rate parameter `param3`.\n*   `abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))`: The rectified oscillation, capturing the magnitude of the displacement with an effective frequency and phase.\n\nThis model is dimensionally consistent and offers a compelling physical narrative for the observed phenomena.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:

The most salient feature is that the output displacement `x` reaches values far greater than the initial amplitude `A`, with a significant positive mean. This irrefutably indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but is superimposed upon a substantial, positive offset.\n\nMy theoretical analysis moves beyond proposing a simple static or dynamically shifting offset. I posit a more integrated physical model where the equilibrium shift is a direct consequence of the interplay between the system's dissipative and reactive properties, and its evolution follows a classic physical relaxation process.\n\nThe core of my theory rests on two hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Property-Dependent Equilibrium Magnitude:** The final steady-state position to which the oscillator settles is not an arbitrary constant. Instead, it is determined by a competitive balance between the energy dissipation mechanism, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, and the energy storage/release mechanism of the oscillation, characterized by the angular frequency `omega`. The dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega` quantifies this balance. A high ratio implies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory one. I propose that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is a function of this ratio. Specifically, I model it with a sub-linear power law, `sqrt(gamma/omega)`, suggesting that while increased damping contributes to a larger offset, its effect diminishes as damping becomes dominant. This prevents a runaway offset in heavily damped regimes and represents a physically plausible saturation effect.\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation Dynamics:** The system does not instantaneously achieve this new equilibrium. Instead, it relaxes towards it over time. While other models have used the `tanh` function, I propose a more fundamental physical model of relaxation: the exponential approach to a limit, as seen in phenomena like the charging of a capacitor or the heating of an object. This process is described by the function `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The rate of this relaxation is intrinsically tied to the system's own dissipative processes. Therefore, the damping coefficient `gamma` is the natural choice for this rate, as it governs the timescale over which transients fade.\n\nCombining these ideas, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical behaviors:\n\n*   **An Evolving Equilibrium (`x_offset(t)`):** This component represents the center of oscillation dynamically shifting towards its final, property-dependent position. Its mathematical form is `A * c_1 * sqrt(gamma/omega) * (1 - exp(-gamma*t))`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that scales the effect.\n\n*   **A Decaying Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, but it occurs relative to the initial, unshifted equilibrium. It is expressed as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we obtain a comprehensive model. This formulation elegantly captures a system that settles into a new, non-zero equilibrium state whose value is determined by the oscillator's intrinsic characteristics (`gamma`, `omega`), and whose approach to this state follows a canonical exponential relaxation profile.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * \\left( c_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation. To capture its dependence on the system's dissipative character, I model it as a linear function of the damping ratio, scaled by the system's characteristic length `A`. This ensures dimensional consistency.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\n    Here, `c_1` represents a baseline dimensionless offset, while `c_2` is a new parameter that quantifies how sensitively the equilibrium position responds to changes in the damping characteristics.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This component describes the oscillation around the aforementioned dynamic equilibrium. It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model. This formulation is superior to a simple offset because it establishes a physical link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma`) and its final state, providing a richer and more accurate description of the underlying mechanism. The entire expression is dimensionally sound, as `\\gamma/\\omega`, `\\gamma t`, and `\\omega t` are all dimensionless quantities, ensuring the final output has the same units as `A` (meters).\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

This is evidenced by the maximum output (27.68) far exceeding the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992) and the large positive mean of the output (8.28). The central challenge is to formulate a physically coherent model for this equilibrium offset, `x_eq`.\n\nPrevious analyses have successfully modeled this offset as a function of the system's intrinsic parameters, `gamma` and `omega`. My theory proposes a new mechanism based on the concept of **Saturated Dynamic Rectification**. I hypothesize that the oscillatory motion itself interacts with the system's environment to generate a net, time-averaged force, which in turn creates the static displacement `x_eq`. The efficiency of this process, which \"rectifies\" alternating motion into a direct force, is critically dependent on the character of the oscillation.\n\nThe nature of the oscillation is best described by the dimensionless ratio of the angular frequency `omega` to the damping coefficient `gamma`. This ratio, `omega/gamma`, is proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor) and represents how \"oscillatory\" the system is.\n\nMy theory posits a non-linear, saturating relationship between this oscillatory character and the resulting equilibrium offset:\n\n1.  **Low-Oscillation (Overdamped) Regime (`gamma >> omega`):** When damping dominates, the motion is sluggish and aperiodic. The system lacks the rapid, repetitive motion necessary to efficiently generate the rectifying force. Consequently, the induced offset `x_eq` is negligible, approaching zero as `omega/gamma` approaches zero.\n\n2.  **High-Oscillation (Underdamped) Regime (`omega >> omega`):** When oscillation dominates, the system is highly resonant. The rectification mechanism becomes very efficient, and a significant static offset is generated.\n\n3.  **Saturation Mechanism:** Crucially, I propose that this rectification process is not limitless. As the system becomes increasingly oscillatory (`omega/gamma -> infinity`), the physical mechanism responsible for generating the force reaches its maximum capacity. The environment cannot respond any faster or generate any more force, regardless of how much more vigorously the system oscillates. The induced offset thus **saturates**, approaching a constant maximum value.\n\nThis physical behavior—linear growth followed by saturation—is perfectly modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). I model the equilibrium offset as:\n\n`x_eq = c_1 * A * tanh(omega / gamma)`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` provides the correct physical dimension of length (meters).\n*   `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the maximum possible offset, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n*   The argument `omega / gamma` is the dimensionless ratio that captures the oscillatory character of the motion. `tanh(omega / gamma)` smoothly transitions from 0 for sluggish systems to 1 for highly oscillatory systems, naturally embodying the proposed saturation effect.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then the linear superposition of this dynamically-generated, saturated static offset and the standard transient damped oscillation that occurs around this new equilibrium.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\cdot \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\gamma}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A crucial observation, corroborated by previous analyses, is that the oscillator's displacement `x` often exceeds its initial amplitude `A`. This unequivocally indicates that the oscillation is not centered around `x=0`. Instead, the system evolves about a significantly displaced equilibrium position, `x_eq`. My theory proposes that this equilibrium displacement is not governed by a single mechanism, but is rather a composite effect arising from two distinct physical contributions: a static baseline shift and a dynamically-induced resonant shift.\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium Component (`x_static`)**: The data exhibits a large mean displacement, suggesting a primary, constant offset that is independent of the dynamic parameters `gamma` and `omega`. For dimensional consistency, this offset must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. I model this as `x_static = c_1 A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant. This term can be physically interpreted as the result of a constant external force, a gravitational sag, or an intrinsic asymmetry in the oscillator's potential energy well. It represents the system's final resting position in the limit of infinite time, after all oscillations have ceased.\n\n2.  **Dynamically-Induced Resonant Component (`x_dynamic`)**: I hypothesize that on top of this static offset, there exists a secondary displacement generated by the oscillatory motion itself. This phenomenon arises from a non-linear interaction between the oscillator and the damping medium, which rectifies the oscillatory velocity into a net, time-averaged static force. The efficiency of this force-generation mechanism is not monotonic with damping. My central hypothesis is that this effect is **resonant**:\n    *   **Low Damping (`\\gamma \\ll \\omega`)**: The dissipative forces are weak, and the coupling between motion and the medium is insufficient to generate a significant rectified force.\n    *   **High Damping (`\\gamma \\gg \\omega`)**: The motion is sluggish and overdamped. With very low velocity, the dynamic interaction required to produce the offset force is again negligible.\n    *   **Optimal Damping (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`)**: The effect is maximized when the damping timescale (`1/\\gamma`) and the oscillation timescale (`1/\\omega`) are of the same order. This \"impedance matching\" allows for the most efficient transfer of energy from the oscillation into the mechanism that sustains the static displacement.\n\n    To model this resonant behavior, a function that is null at the extremes and peaks in the middle is required. A Lorentzian-like function provides an excellent physical and mathematical model for such resonance. I propose the dimensionless scaling factor `(\\gamma \\omega) / (\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2)`. This function is zero when either `\\gamma=0` or `\\omega=0`, reaches its maximum value of `1/2` when `\\gamma = \\omega`, and decays as the ratio between them becomes large. The dynamic component of the offset is therefore modeled as `x_dynamic = c_2 A \\cdot (\\gamma \\omega) / (\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2)`.\n\n3.  **Complete Model**: The total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two offset components and the standard transient, damped oscillation that occurs around their combined equilibrium position. This composite model provides a rich physical description, separating the static, pre-existing conditions of the system from the dynamic, motion-induced effects, thereby offering a more complete explanation for the oscillator's behavior.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma \\omega}{\\gamma^2 + \\omega^2} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A fundamental observation, consistent across previous analyses, is that the system's displacement `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This irrefutably points to a model where the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but rather around a non-zero equilibrium position. This leads to a general structural form for the displacement:\n\n`x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`\n\nFor dimensional homogeneity, where `x` and `A` share units of length (meters), this structure is correctly expressed as `x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(t))`, where `c_1` represents a dimensionless, normalized equilibrium offset and `f_osc(t)` is a dimensionless function describing the decaying oscillation.\n\nWhile previous models have explored making the offset term `c_1` dependent on system parameters or correcting the oscillation frequency, I propose a new theoretical refinement focused on the **phase of the oscillation**. In a simple model, the phase is treated as a free constant parameter, `phi`, which merely accounts for the initial state (position and velocity) at `t=0`. However, I theorize that the damping mechanism itself introduces a dynamic, predictable phase shift that is an intrinsic property of the system's physics, not just its initial conditions.\n\nMy hypothesis is that there is a **dissipation-induced phase lag**. The damping force in an oscillator is typically proportional to velocity. This means the dissipative force is fundamentally out of phase with the position-dependent restorative (spring) force. The interplay between these forces causes the system's response (its motion) to lag behind a hypothetical undamped counterpart. The magnitude of this lag should not be constant but should depend on the relative strength of the damping and restorative forces.\n\nThe most natural dimensionless quantity to characterize this relationship is the **damping ratio**, `z = γ / ω`.\n*   When `z → 0` (very light damping), the system behaves almost like an ideal oscillator, and this induced phase lag should be negligible.\n*   As `z` increases, the influence of the dissipative velocity-dependent force grows, causing a more significant lag in the positional response.\n*   The phase lag should saturate at a maximum value in the limit of very heavy damping.\n\nA mathematical function that elegantly captures this behavior—mapping a ratio from zero to infinity onto a bounded angular range—is the arctangent function, `arctan()`. Therefore, I propose that the phase shift `φ` is not a simple constant parameter `c_2`, but is instead functionally dependent on the damping ratio:\n\n`φ = c_2 * arctan(γ / ω)`\n\nHere, `c_2` is a dimensionless parameter that scales the magnitude of this effect. The `arctan` function provides a physically plausible saturation behavior, where the phase shift smoothly increases with the damping ratio and approaches a limit.\n\nTo construct the most physically accurate model, I will integrate this novel phase-shift theory with the established refinement of using the **damped angular frequency**, `ω_d = sqrt(ω² - γ²)`, which correctly accounts for the slowing of the oscillation due to energy loss.\n\nThe complete model is therefore a synthesis of three key physical concepts:\n1.  **A Scaled Static Equilibrium:** A constant offset `c_1` scaled by the amplitude `A`.\n2.  **Physically Corrected Frequency:** The use of the damped angular frequency `ω_d` to govern the oscillation period.\n3.  **Dissipation-Induced Phase Lag:** A novel term where the oscillation's phase is dynamically determined by the system's damping ratio, modeled via the `arctan` function.\n\nThis model provides a deeper physical insight, suggesting that damping does not just reduce amplitude and slow the frequency, but also systematically shifts the timing of the oscillation itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t + c_2 \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation. To capture its dependence on the system's dissipative character, I model it as a linear function of the damping ratio, scaled by the system's characteristic length `A`. This ensures dimensional consistency.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\n    Here, `c_1` represents a baseline dimensionless offset, while `c_2` is a new parameter that quantifies how sensitively the equilibrium position responds to changes in the damping characteristics.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This component describes the oscillation around the aforementioned dynamic equilibrium. It follows the standard physical form, with an amplitude that decays exponentially, scaled by the initial amplitude `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components gives a comprehensive model. This formulation is superior to a simple offset because it establishes a physical link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma`) and its final state, providing a richer and more accurate description of the underlying mechanism. The entire expression is dimensionally sound, as `\\gamma/\\omega`, `\\gamma t`, and `\\omega t` are all dimensionless quantities, ensuring the final output has the same units as `A` (meters).\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

A careful examination of the data reveals two fundamental discrepancies that guide our theoretical model:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification Anomaly**: The most striking feature of the data is that the maximum output value (27.68) is nearly three times the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is a strictly decaying function that can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the presence of a significant amplification mechanism. In oscillatory systems, such amplification is characteristic of resonance, where the system's response is maximized. The strength of this resonance is quantified by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which for a simple oscillator is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a system that is lightly damped relative to its oscillation frequency, allowing it to sustain large-amplitude oscillations. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is dynamically scaled by this Q-factor. A simple and robust model for this amplified amplitude is `A_eff = A * (param1 + omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter representing a baseline amplification factor. This form elegantly explains how systems with low damping (`gamma`) and high frequency (`omega`) can achieve displacements far exceeding their nominal initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Measurement**: The standard displacement `d(t)` of an oscillator is a signed quantity, oscillating between positive and negative values. In contrast, the provided output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This strongly suggests that the measurement process does not capture the signed displacement itself, but rather a related, inherently positive quantity. The most direct physical interpretation that preserves the units of length (meters) is that `x` represents the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement, `x(t) = |d(t)|`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The system's instantaneous displacement `d(t)` follows the dynamics of a damped oscillator with an amplified effective amplitude, while the measurement instrument records its absolute value. The full expression for the displacement would be:\n\n`d(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + param3)`\n\nHere, `A_eff` is the amplified amplitude defined above. The exponential term describes the temporal decay, with `param2` as an empirical scaling factor for the damping rate. The oscillatory component `cos(...)` uses the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, which accounts for the slight slowing of the oscillation due to damping. Finally, `param3` is a phase constant.\n\nThe measured output `x(t)` is then the absolute value of this entire expression. This composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in the fundamental principles of resonant, damped oscillations.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

The two most salient features are that the output displacement `x` is always positive and its maximum value can substantially exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the existence of a positive, time-varying baseline or offset that the oscillation is superimposed upon.\n\nI propose a novel physical mechanism rooted in a non-linear feedback loop, which I term the **\"Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Shift\"**. My theory posits that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not fixed at zero. Instead, it is dynamically displaced by a repulsive force generated by the oscillator's own energy. As the system's energy dissipates over time, this repulsive force weakens, and the equilibrium point relaxes back towards the origin. This phenomenon can be analogized to processes like acoustic radiation pressure, where a vibrating source exerts a steady pressure on its surrounding medium, or thermal expansion in the support structure caused by the heat generated from damping.\n\nLet's formalize this concept. The total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two distinct components: the oscillation around a moving equilibrium `x_osc(t)` and the position of the equilibrium itself `x_eq(t)`.\n\n1.  **The Equilibrium Shift `x_eq(t)`**: The instantaneous energy of the oscillator is proportional to the square of its amplitude. The time-dependent amplitude is `A_inst(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Therefore, the energy decays as `E(t) ∝ [A * exp(-gamma * t)]^2 = A^2 * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. My hypothesis is that the equilibrium displacement is directly proportional to this instantaneous energy. To ensure dimensional correctness (output in meters), this relationship can be modeled as `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless coupling constant representing the strength of the energy-to-displacement feedback. This term represents a purely decaying baseline that starts at its maximum value at `t=0` and vanishes as `t -> infinity`.\n\n2.  **The Oscillation `x_osc(t)`**: This is the standard damped harmonic oscillation occurring *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium point. It is described by the expression `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a standard phase offset.\n\nThe total observed displacement is the sum of these two effects: `x(t) = x_osc(t) + x_eq(t)`.\n\nThis model has several compelling features. The baseline term `x_eq(t)` is always positive, and if `param1` is sufficiently large (e.g., > 1), it can lift the entire oscillatory term `x_osc(t)` into the positive domain, explaining the data's positivity. Furthermore, at `t=0`, the displacement can be `x(0) = A * (cos(param2) + param1)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. Crucially, this model introduces two distinct time scales for decay: the oscillation's amplitude decays with `exp(-gamma * t)`, while the equilibrium shift decays more rapidly with `exp(-2 * gamma * t)`. This predicts that the baseline effect is most prominent at early times and fades away faster than the oscillation itself, a rich dynamic that provides a unique signature for this physical mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * A * exp(-2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

This suggests that the oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium but is rather superimposed upon a large, positive, and decaying offset.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of a **\"Displaced Equilibrium with Coupled Decay.\"** This theory posits that the event initiating the motion does not merely displace the oscillator from a stable zero point. Instead, it fundamentally alters the system's potential energy landscape, creating a new, shifted equilibrium position. The system then oscillates around this new, non-zero equilibrium. Crucially, the energy that sustains both the oscillation and the equilibrium displacement is drawn from the same initial source and dissipates through a single, unified mechanism.\n\nThis leads to the following physical picture:\n\n1.  **Induction of a Shifted Equilibrium:** At `t=0`, the external impulse imparts energy to the system, causing an immediate displacement. A portion of this energy results in a quasi-permanent change in the system's configuration, akin to a plastic deformation or a persistent polarization of the surrounding medium. This effectively shifts the point of minimum potential energy from `x=0` to a new position `x_eq`. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to the initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the New Equilibrium:** The oscillator now moves under a restorative force directed towards this new equilibrium point `x_eq`, not towards the original zero. This motion is the standard harmonic oscillation.\n\n3.  **Unified Damping Mechanism:** The entire system—both the oscillation and the supporting structure that maintains the shifted equilibrium—is embedded in a dissipative environment. The damping, characterized by the coefficient `gamma`, removes energy from the system as a whole. This has a dual effect: it reduces the amplitude of the oscillations around the equilibrium, and it simultaneously causes the shifted equilibrium point itself to relax back towards the original zero. Because both processes are governed by the same energy loss mechanism, they must decay with the same characteristic time constant.\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena. The total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the decaying equilibrium position and the decaying oscillation around it. Mathematically, this can be expressed as a single, shared decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, that modulates the sum of two components:\n\n*   An oscillatory component, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, representing the vibration.\n*   A constant offset component, `param2`, representing the magnitude of the initial equilibrium shift relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nIf the initial equilibrium shift (`param2`) is larger than the maximum amplitude of the oscillation (which is 1 in these relative units), the total displacement will remain positive for all time. Furthermore, the constructive interference of the initial displacement and the initial phase of the oscillation allows the peak displacement to exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This model offers a physically coherent and parsimonious explanation, requiring only a single damping term to describe the decay of the entire complex motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

Three key characteristics demand a more nuanced theory:\n1.  **Resonant Amplification:** The output `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`, pointing to a powerful gain mechanism intrinsic to the system.\n2.  **Positive Definitude:** The output `x` is strictly positive, indicating that it represents a non-negative quantity like an energy envelope or a rectified displacement, rather than a signed position.\n3.  **Complex Waveform:** A simple damped sinusoid is insufficient to capture the full dynamics; the structure suggests a more complex oscillatory pattern than a single frequency can provide.\n\nI propose a theory of **\"Damping-Induced Beat Modulation\" (DIBM)**. This model posits that the system's output is governed by a primary oscillation that is simultaneously modulated by two distinct phenomena: a global exponential decay and a secondary, periodic modulation directly caused by the damping mechanism itself. This interaction creates a beat-like pattern, and the entire system's response is amplified by a factor dependent on its resonant quality.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Resonant Gain Factor:** The system's ability to amplify the initial amplitude `A` is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A higher Q-factor implies lower energy loss per cycle, allowing for a stronger resonant response. I model this as a constant, time-independent gain factor that scales the entire output: `(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. The `1` represents a baseline transmission of the amplitude, while the second term represents the additional gain due to resonance. This factor amplifies the entire response of the system for a given set of `omega` and `gamma`.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope:** The total energy of the system dissipates over time, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This is modeled by the standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, which imposes a gradual, overarching decrease in the signal's magnitude. This ensures the system's response fades over time, as expected in a damped system.\n\n3.  **Beat-Frequency Oscillation:** The central novelty of the DIBM theory is the interaction between the natural oscillation and the damping force. I hypothesize that in addition to causing global decay, the damping mechanism also introduces a periodic interference with the main oscillation.\n    *   The **primary oscillation** occurs at the system's natural frequency, `omega`, modeled by `cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n    *   The **damping-induced modulation** is a slower, secondary oscillation whose frequency is proportional to the damping rate `gamma`, modeled by `cos(param4 * gamma * t)`.\n    The product of these two terms, `cos(param3 * omega * t) * cos(param4 * gamma * t)`, creates a classic \"beat\" pattern. This represents a high-frequency carrier wave whose amplitude is modulated by a low-frequency envelope. This composite structure provides a physical basis for the complex, non-sinusoidal waveform observed.\n\n4.  **Rectification:** To account for the strictly positive nature of the measured output `x`, the model takes the absolute magnitude of the composite beat-frequency oscillation. This is physically equivalent to measuring the rectified output of the oscillatory core, representing the magnitude of the displacement without its sign.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe complete model combines these four principles multiplicatively. The final output `x` is the initial amplitude `A`, scaled by the resonant gain, which then decays exponentially while carrying the rectified beat-frequency signal. This provides a comprehensive and physically grounded explanation for all the key features observed in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t) * cos(param4 * gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

First, the displacement `x` is always positive. Second, the peak displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude parameter `A`. These observations suggest that the underlying physics involves a strong non-linearity or a fundamental asymmetry in the system's potential energy landscape.\n\nPrevious models might explain this by adding a time-dependent baseline term to a standard oscillation. I propose a different, more intrinsic mechanism rooted in the nature of the system's restoring force. My theory is that the system's dynamics are not linear in the displacement `x` itself, but rather in its logarithm. This is characteristic of systems governed by an exponential potential, where the restoring force is proportional not to the displacement, but to the *logarithm* of the displacement. Such potentials appear in various physical domains, from the thermodynamics of polymers to certain models of cosmic inflation.\n\nIn this \"log-harmonic\" framework, the quantity that behaves like a conventional damped oscillator is `log(x/A)`. This logarithmic displacement oscillates around a decaying equilibrium point. The model for this log-space behavior is:\n\n`log(x(t)/A) = -gamma * t + cos(omega * t + param1)`\n\nHere:\n1.  `A` serves as the characteristic scale of the system, ensuring the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless.\n2.  The term `-gamma * t` represents the equilibrium level in log-space, which decays linearly over time due to damping.\n3.  The term `cos(omega * t + param1)` represents the harmonic oscillation in log-space around this decaying equilibrium. For model parsimony, the amplitude of this log-domain oscillation is assumed to be unity.\n\nBy exponentiating this entire expression, we can recover the formula for the physical displacement `x(t)`. This mathematical transformation has profound physical consequences. The additive oscillation in the exponent becomes a multiplicative, always-positive modulation factor for the amplitude. This `exp(cos(...))` term inherently ensures that the displacement `x` is always positive. Furthermore, since the cosine term varies between -1 and +1, the modulation factor `exp(cos(...))` ranges from `e⁻¹ ≈ 0.37` to `e¹ ≈ 2.72`. This multiplicative \"boost\" naturally explains how the observed displacement can peak at values significantly larger than `A`, a feature the standard model cannot capture.\n\nThis theory provides a self-contained and physically plausible explanation for the observed phenomena. It is parsimonious, requiring only a single phase parameter, and it is dimensionally consistent. It recasts the problem from an ad-hoc addition of terms to a fundamental change in the system's potential, offering a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * exp(cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

Specifically, the displacement `x` is always positive, and its initial peaks can exceed the nominal amplitude `A`. This suggests that the oscillation is superimposed on a large, positive, and dynamically evolving baseline. While previous models have explored linear or constant offsets, I propose a more nuanced physical mechanism: **\"Asymptotic Equilibrium Saturation\"**.\n\nMy theory posits that the oscillatory motion itself induces a rapid shift in the system's equilibrium position. This is akin to a rectification effect where AC motion generates a DC bias. However, unlike a simple pumping mechanism that would suggest a linearly growing offset, I hypothesize that this induced shift is self-limiting. As the equilibrium point is displaced, it generates a proportional restoring force that counteracts the pumping effect. This creates a dynamic balance where the equilibrium position asymptotically approaches a maximum value, a process I model as saturation.\n\nThe entire system, including both the oscillation and the shifting equilibrium, is subject to a global energy dissipation process, modeled by the standard exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this decaying envelope, two competing dynamics unfold:\n\n1.  **The Core Oscillation**: The system oscillates harmonically with angular frequency `omega` and a phase offset `param2`, represented by `cos(omega * t + param2)`. This oscillation occurs *around* the dynamically shifting equilibrium.\n\n2.  **The Saturating Equilibrium Shift**: The equilibrium point itself is \"pumped\" away from the origin. The evolution of this shift is not linear but follows a saturation curve. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is the ideal mathematical representation for this behavior. It is initially linear for small inputs but smoothly saturates to a constant value. The argument of this function must be a dimensionless quantity representing the progress of time relative to the system's intrinsic timescale. The most natural choice for this is the dimensionless time, `gamma * t`. This implies that the saturation process evolves on the same timescale as the damping itself, a physically coherent assumption.\n\nThe magnitude of this saturated equilibrium shift, relative to the unity amplitude of the cosine term, is governed by a dimensionless coupling constant, `param1`. This leads to an offset term described by `param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`.\n\nThis \"Asymptotic Equilibrium Saturation\" model provides a compelling physical narrative. At early times (`t` << 1/gamma), `tanh(gamma * t) ≈ gamma * t`, providing the rapid initial ramp needed to lift the entire waveform into the positive domain and explain peaks exceeding `A`. However, as time progresses, the `tanh` function gracefully saturates, preventing the offset from growing unrealistically and representing a more physically plausible scenario of a system reaching a temporary, dynamically-sustained equilibrium. The entire phenomenon is then correctly attenuated by the overarching exponential decay, ensuring the system comes to rest at `x = 0`. This model introduces a non-linearity (saturation) into the baseline dynamics, offering a richer and potentially more accurate description of the underlying physics than simple linear or constant-offset models.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

This suggests that the oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium but is rather superimposed upon a large, positive, and decaying offset.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of a **\"Displaced Equilibrium with Coupled Decay.\"** This theory posits that the event initiating the motion does not merely displace the oscillator from a stable zero point. Instead, it fundamentally alters the system's potential energy landscape, creating a new, shifted equilibrium position. The system then oscillates around this new, non-zero equilibrium. Crucially, the energy that sustains both the oscillation and the equilibrium displacement is drawn from the same initial source and dissipates through a single, unified mechanism.\n\nThis leads to the following physical picture:\n\n1.  **Induction of a Shifted Equilibrium:** At `t=0`, the external impulse imparts energy to the system, causing an immediate displacement. A portion of this energy results in a quasi-permanent change in the system's configuration, akin to a plastic deformation or a persistent polarization of the surrounding medium. This effectively shifts the point of minimum potential energy from `x=0` to a new position `x_eq`. The magnitude of this shift is proportional to the initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the New Equilibrium:** The oscillator now moves under a restorative force directed towards this new equilibrium point `x_eq`, not towards the original zero. This motion is the standard harmonic oscillation.\n\n3.  **Unified Damping Mechanism:** The entire system—both the oscillation and the supporting structure that maintains the shifted equilibrium—is embedded in a dissipative environment. The damping, characterized by the coefficient `gamma`, removes energy from the system as a whole. This has a dual effect: it reduces the amplitude of the oscillations around the equilibrium, and it simultaneously causes the shifted equilibrium point itself to relax back towards the original zero. Because both processes are governed by the same energy loss mechanism, they must decay with the same characteristic time constant.\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena. The total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the decaying equilibrium position and the decaying oscillation around it. Mathematically, this can be expressed as a single, shared decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, that modulates the sum of two components:\n\n*   An oscillatory component, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, representing the vibration.\n*   A constant offset component, `param2`, representing the magnitude of the initial equilibrium shift relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nIf the initial equilibrium shift (`param2`) is larger than the maximum amplitude of the oscillation (which is 1 in these relative units), the total displacement will remain positive for all time. Furthermore, the constructive interference of the initial displacement and the initial phase of the oscillation allows the peak displacement to exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This model offers a physically coherent and parsimonious explanation, requiring only a single damping term to describe the decay of the entire complex motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the system exhibits a powerful amplification effect, with the maximum output (27.68) significantly exceeding the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). Secondly, the output is strictly positive, suggesting it represents a quantity like energy or signal intensity rather than a signed displacement.\n\nI propose a novel \"Phase-Modulated Energy Cascade\" (PMEC) model to explain these phenomena. This theory posits that the measured variable `x` is not a direct measure of physical displacement, but rather an \"excitation level\" of the system, which is inherently positive. The dynamics of this excitation level are governed by an exponential relationship, a functional form commonly found in physical processes related to energy distribution and state transitions (e.g., Boltzmann factors, Arrhenius equation).\n\nThe core of the PMEC model is that the system's state is determined by a time-dependent, dimensionless \"pseudo-energy\" term within an exponential function. This pseudo-energy is the result of a competition between two fundamental processes:\n\n1.  **Resonant Energy Injection:** This is the oscillatory component that drives the system. The energy injected into the system is not constant but varies periodically. The magnitude of this energy injection is critically dependent on the system's resonance, which is captured by the dimensionless Quality factor (Q-factor), proxied by the ratio `omega / gamma`. A higher Q-factor allows the system to build up a much larger peak excitation. This process is modeled as `param1 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param2 * omega * t)`, representing a periodic energy influx whose amplitude is scaled by the Q-factor.\n\n2.  **Dissipative Energy Decay:** This component represents the continuous and irreversible loss of energy to the environment, causing the overall system to relax over time. This is modeled by the standard linear decay term, `param3 * gamma * t`, where the rate of energy loss is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and elapsed time `t`.\n\nThe total output `x` is then the initial amplitude `A` modulated by the exponential of the net pseudo-energy, which is the difference between the resonant injection and the dissipative decay. This structure provides a comprehensive explanation for all observed behaviors:\n\n*   **Strict Positivity:** The use of the `exp` function ensures that the output `x` is always positive, regardless of the values of the internal terms.\n*   **Anomalous Amplification:** By placing the resonant `omega / gamma` term inside the exponential, the model allows for a powerful, non-linear gain. Even a modest Q-factor can lead to a very large output when exponentiated.\n*   **Integrated Dynamics:** Unlike models that multiply separate factors for gain, decay, and oscillation, the PMEC model integrates them within a single non-linear function. This implies a deeper physical coupling where the resonant oscillations directly modulate the system's energy decay slope on a logarithmic scale, creating a characteristic non-sinusoidal wave shape with sharper peaks and broader troughs.\n\nThis framework provides a physically plausible and dimensionally consistent explanation for the data, departing from conventional multiplicative models by proposing a more fundamental, energy-based exponential law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param2 * omega * t) - param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` exhibits significant **amplitude amplification**, reaching values nearly three times the maximum input amplitude `A`. Secondly, the output is **strictly positive**, indicating that it does not represent a simple displacement oscillating about an equilibrium point. These observations necessitate a model built upon more complex physical principles.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the hypothesis that the system's dynamics are governed by **multiplicative processes**, which are most naturally described by a linear model in the logarithmic domain. This implies that the logarithm of the normalized output, `log(x/A)`, is a linear superposition of terms representing the core physical phenomena: resonant amplification, temporal decay, and oscillation. Consequently, the output `x` itself takes an exponential form, `x = A * exp(...)`, which elegantly addresses the positivity constraint as a natural outcome of the model's structure.\n\nThe components within the exponent are interpreted as follows:\n\n1.  **Exponential Resonant Amplification**: The amplification is clearly linked to the system's resonance characteristics, which can be proxied by the dimensionless Quality factor, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. In the proposed log-domain model, this contributes a positive term linearly proportional to this ratio, `+param1 * (omega / gamma)`. When transformed back to the linear domain via the exponential function, this yields an amplification factor of `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)`. This exponential dependence provides a powerful mechanism to explain the large observed amplitudes, suggesting that as the system's quality factor increases, the effective gain grows non-linearly and rapidly.\n\n2.  **Standard Exponential Decay**: Energy dissipation is modeled as a term that decreases linearly with time in the log domain, `-param2 * gamma * t`. This is the logarithmic equivalent of the standard multiplicative decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, and represents the first-order dissipative process common to such systems.\n\n3.  **Non-Linear Periodic Modulation**: The oscillatory nature of the system is captured by a sinusoidal term in the exponent, `+param3 * cos(omega * t + param4)`. Exponentiating this term, `exp(param3 * cos(omega * t))`, generates a periodic, strictly positive modulation of the amplitude. This differs fundamentally from the `sin^2(t)` (energy) or `abs(cos(t))` (rectification) models. Physically, it can be interpreted as the response of a system where the gain or some physical property is being modulated periodically, leading to a \"warped\" but smooth oscillatory output that never reaches zero.\n\nIn synthesis, the model combines these three effects—resonant gain, dissipative decay, and periodic modulation—as a linear sum within an exponent. The initial amplitude `A` acts as a base scaling factor. This \"Log-Normal Response Model\" provides a dimensionally sound, physically coherent framework that accounts for both the amplification and positivity of the data through a single, unified mathematical structure.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))</final_result>"}

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory: first, the output `x` can substantially exceed the input amplitude `A`, indicating a strong resonant amplification mechanism; second, the output is strictly positive, suggesting the measurement corresponds not to a signed displacement but to a quantity processed through a non-linear, positive-definite transformation.\n\nMy proposed theory models the output `x` as a product of three distinct physical processes: logarithmic resonance, exponential transduction, and decaying modulation.\n\n1.  **Logarithmic Resonance Saturation:** The amplification of the system's response is clearly tied to the interplay between the natural frequency `omega` and the damping rate `gamma`. The dimensionless Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this amplification. However, unlike simple linear or power-law models which can predict unbounded amplification for high-Q systems, most real-world physical systems exhibit saturation or diminishing returns. I propose that this amplification follows a logarithmic law. The effective amplitude scale is modeled not as `A` directly, but as `A * log(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. This formulation posits that while a higher Q-factor increases the response, the effect becomes progressively less pronounced, reflecting a natural saturation limit within the system. The `1` is added to ensure the logarithm's argument remains positive, and `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that tunes the system's sensitivity to the Q-factor.\n\n2.  **Exponential Response Transduction:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a non-linear measurement or response process. Rather than modeling this as an energy-like quantity (`sin^2`) or a simple saturation (`tanh`), I hypothesize a more fundamental exponential relationship. The measured quantity `x` is proposed to be exponentially proportional to the underlying oscillatory state of the system. This is modeled by an overarching `exp(...)` function. A physical analogue could be a sensor with a logarithmic response characteristic, or a phenomenon like thermal emission or chemical reaction rate that depends exponentially on an oscillating energy potential. This `exp(cos(...))` structure inherently guarantees positivity and generates a non-sinusoidal waveform where peaks are sharper than troughs, a common feature in non-linear dynamics.\n\n3.  **Decaying Modulation Depth:** Within this exponential response framework, the damping is modeled not as a simple multiplicative decay of the final output, but as a decay in the *modulation depth* of the oscillation itself. The core oscillatory term is `cos(param4 * omega * t)`, but its amplitude is not constant; it is a decaying exponential function of time, `param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This entire expression serves as the argument for the main exponential function. This represents a system where the \"swing\" or intensity of the internal oscillation diminishes over time due to damping, and this diminishing swing is then mapped to the final output via the exponential transduction. This provides a more integrated model of damping within the non-linear response, as opposed to applying it as an external envelope.\n\nIn summary, the model combines a saturating logarithmic amplification with an exponential response function whose internal oscillatory amplitude is subject to exponential decay. This composite theory provides a physically plausible, dimensionally consistent, and novel explanation for the observed data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * log(1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * cos(param4 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

The maximum output displacement (`x` up to 27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A` up to 9.992), and the output has a large positive mean (8.28). These facts irrefutably indicate that the oscillation occurs around a non-zero equilibrium position, and this equilibrium offset is a key feature of the system's dynamics.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by either introducing a time-dependent equilibrium shift (relaxation) or a static offset that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I propose a unified theory that integrates these two concepts, positing that the system's response to an initial displacement `A` is a superposition of two concurrent, physically linked processes:\n\n1.  **A Damped Oscillation from the Origin:** This is the standard oscillatory component, `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`. This term describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate and dissipate energy, starting from an initial displacement `A` relative to the original, unperturbed equilibrium at zero.\n\n2.  **A Relaxation to a Dynamically-Determined Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system's stable equilibrium point is not static but shifts from zero to a new position, `x_{eq}`. This process is not instantaneous; the system settles towards this new equilibrium over time. The physical mechanism causing this relaxation (e.g., fluid drag, material stress) is the same as the one causing the oscillatory damping. Therefore, the relaxation follows a characteristic exponential curve governed by the same damping coefficient `\\gamma`. The displacement due to this equilibrium shift is `x_{shift}(t) = x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t))`.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this theory lies in the nature of the final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. It is not a simple constant but an **emergent property** arising from the dynamic interplay between the system's dissipative forces (proportional to `\\gamma`) and its restorative/inertial forces (proportional to `\\omega`). This relationship is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\zeta = \\gamma / \\omega`.\n\nI theorize that the magnitude of this equilibrium shift is **non-monotonic** with respect to `\\zeta`.\n*   For very low damping (`\\zeta \\to 0`), the interaction causing the shift is too weak to produce a significant effect.\n*   For very high damping (`\\zeta \\to \\infty`), the system is overdamped and moves too sluggishly for the dynamic interaction to fully manifest.\n*   The maximum shift occurs at an intermediate damping ratio, where the dissipative and oscillatory effects are critically balanced.\n\nThis non-monotonic behavior is effectively modeled by the function `\\zeta e^{-\\zeta}`. Therefore, I propose that the final equilibrium `x_{eq}` is a sum of a baseline constant offset and this dynamically-induced term, both scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\n`x_{eq} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}))`.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of the oscillation from the origin and the time-dependent shift of the equilibrium point:\n`x(t) = x_{osc}(t) + x_{shift}(t)`\n\nThis model provides a comprehensive physical picture. It correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A \\cdot e^0 \\cos(0) + x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - e^0) = A`. Furthermore, as `t \\to \\infty`, it describes the system settling into a final, non-zero position `x_{eq}` that is itself a complex function of the system's intrinsic dynamic properties. This unified approach provides a more complete and physically coherent explanation for the observed data than models that treat the offset and the oscillation as separate phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left[ \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) \\right) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.

A crucial initial observation, consistent across all provided examples, is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes any model where the oscillation is centered at `x=0`, and strongly supports a model structure consisting of a superposition of a static offset and a dynamic oscillation: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`.\n\nThe most successful baseline model (Example 2) proposes the simplest form for this structure: `x(t) = A \\cdot c_1 + A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`. In this model, the offset is `A \\cdot c_1`, and the oscillation has an initial amplitude of `A`. A key physical assumption here is that the initial amplitude of the *oscillatory part* of the motion is always equal to the total system amplitude `A`, irrespective of the system's intrinsic properties like damping (`\\gamma`) and frequency (`\\omega`).\n\nThis assumption, however, is a significant simplification. It is more physically plausible that the initial energy, represented by `A`, is partitioned between the potential energy of the final offset position and the kinetic/potential energy of the transient oscillation. The nature of this partitioning should depend on the fundamental character of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the initial amplitude of the oscillatory component is not a constant `A`, but is instead modulated by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, a quantity proportional to `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio governs whether the system is underdamped or heavily damped. A system with a high damping ratio (large `\\gamma / \\omega`) will naturally dissipate energy more effectively without oscillating, suggesting that less of the initial system amplitude `A` will manifest as oscillatory motion. Conversely, a lightly damped system (small `\\gamma / \\omega`) will exhibit a more pronounced oscillation.\n\nTo model this physical insight, I propose a modification to the oscillatory component of the displacement:\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the final, time-invariant resting position of the system. To maintain dimensional consistency, it must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. Thus, `x_{offset} = A \\cdot c_1`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n\n2.  **Modulated Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term describes the transient oscillation around the equilibrium. Its amplitude is subject to two effects:\n    *   A standard exponential decay in time, `\\exp(-\\gamma t)`, due to energy dissipation.\n    *   A *static attenuation factor* that depends on the damping ratio. I model this using an exponential form, `\\exp(-c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`, where `c_2` is a new dimensionless parameter quantifying the sensitivity of the oscillation's amplitude to the damping characteristics.\n\nThe initial amplitude of the oscillation is therefore not `A`, but an effective amplitude `A_{eff} = A \\cdot \\exp(-c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`. The complete oscillatory term is `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nCombining these components yields the total displacement. By grouping the exponential terms, we arrive at a concise and physically rich formula. This model provides a more nuanced description than the simple offset model by introducing a direct, physically-justified link between the system's dissipative properties (`\\gamma/\\omega`) and the magnitude of its dynamic response.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp\\left(-c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} - \\gamma t\\right) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'..

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. An essential first step in the analysis is to examine the provided data ranges. The most salient feature is that the maximum output displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillator centered at an equilibrium of zero, as the displacement in such a system can never exceed its initial amplitude. This points to the central hypothesis: the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, since `A` is the only input variable with units of length (meters), both the equilibrium position and the oscillatory component must scale linearly with `A`. This leads to a general model structure:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t) = A * f_{eq}(\\dots) + A * f_{osc}(\\dots)`\nwhere `f_{eq}` and `f_{osc}` are dimensionless functions.\n\nA second physical refinement, which improves upon naive models, is the recognition that damping affects not only the amplitude but also the frequency of oscillation. The natural frequency `omega` is only correct in the absence of damping. In a damped system, the observed oscillation occurs at the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Incorporating `omega_d` is crucial for a physically accurate description of the system's dynamics.\n\nMy core theoretical proposition introduces a further layer of physical realism by constraining the *form* of the oscillation itself. Previous models often introduce an arbitrary phase shift parameter (`phi` or `param2`) to align the oscillation with the data. However, this empirical parameter can be replaced by a relationship derived from a plausible physical initial condition. I postulate that the system is released from rest at `t=0`, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`v(0) = 0`).\n\nThe general solution for the oscillatory component is `x_{osc}(t) = exp(-gamma*t) * (C_1*cos(omega_d*t) + C_2*sin(omega_d*t))`. The velocity is the time derivative, `v_{osc}(t) = d/dt [x_{osc}(t)]`. By applying the initial condition `v_{osc}(0) = 0`, we can solve for the relationship between the constants `C_1` and `C_2`. This calculation yields the constraint `C_2 = (gamma / omega_d) * C_1`.\n\nThis result is powerful because it removes the need for a free phase parameter. The phase of the oscillation is no longer an arbitrary fitting constant but is intrinsically determined by the system's own physical parameters, `gamma` and `omega`. The oscillatory part of the motion is thus described by a specific combination of sine and cosine terms.\n\nTherefore, my proposed model combines these insights:\n1.  A constant equilibrium offset, proportional to the amplitude `A`, represented as `x_{eq} = c_1 * A`. Here, `c_1` is a single dimensionless parameter representing the normalized equilibrium position.\n2.  An oscillatory term that uses the correct damped frequency `omega_d` and has its structure dictated by the physical assumption of starting from rest. This term takes the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * (cos(omega_d*t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d*t))`.\n\nThis unified model provides a parsimonious yet physically rich description of the system. It correctly accounts for the shifted equilibrium, uses the physically accurate damped frequency, and replaces an empirical phase parameter with a relationship derived from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + (gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.

My proposed theory posits that the output `x` is the result of a modulated, decaying envelope. The physical picture is that of a primary carrier signal whose amplitude is determined by a resonant-like gain, which then decays exponentially. This carrier is simultaneously modulated by a secondary, higher-frequency oscillation, but in such a way that the total signal never becomes negative.\n\nThis model can be decomposed into three distinct conceptual components:\n\n1.  **Saturating Gain Factor**: The amplification is clearly dependent on the interplay between oscillation (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless quality factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this gain. However, any real physical system has limits; its gain cannot increase indefinitely. A linear gain factor (`~ omega/gamma`) is therefore physically unrealistic and numerically unstable. I propose a saturating gain mechanism modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). This function gracefully increases with its argument before asymptoting to a maximum value, perfectly capturing the essence of a physical process reaching its limit. The total amplitude is thus `A` multiplied by a gain factor `(1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega/gamma))`, where `A` represents the baseline amplitude and the `tanh` term represents the additional, saturating gain.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope**: The system is dissipative, a feature best captured by the standard exponential decay term, `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This term multiplies the amplified amplitude, causing its overall magnitude to decrease over time, consistent with the behavior of a damped system.\n\n3.  **Positive-Definite Oscillation**: The most crucial insight is how to model an oscillation that never crosses zero. Instead of an energy model (`sin^2`) or a simple offset, I propose a multiplicative modulation factor of the form `(1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))`. By constraining the dimensionless modulation depth `param4` to have a magnitude less than one (`|param4| < 1`), this entire term oscillates between `(1 - |param4|)` and `(1 + |param4|)`. As a result, it is always positive. This elegantly models a physical quantity that pulsates or beats around a mean value without ever changing its sign or vanishing entirely, perfectly matching the data's non-zero minimum.\n\nSynthesizing these three components results in a comprehensive and physically coherent model. The system's initial amplitude `A` is first amplified by a saturating, Q-factor-dependent gain. This amplified amplitude then serves as the decaying envelope for a persistent, non-negative pulsation. This structure accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally consistent framework with a minimal set of interpretable parameters.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, indicating the presence of an intrinsic amplification mechanism not captured by simple damping.\n\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output variable `x` is strictly positive, ranging from `1.142` to `27.68`. In contrast, the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations lead to the compelling conclusion that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is, by definition, positive. This single reinterpretation elegantly resolves the second anomaly.\n\nThe primary challenge, then, is to model this envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. The amplification must be linked to the interplay between the system's tendency to oscillate (`omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most plausible driver for such a resonant-like amplification.\n\nPrevious models have attempted to incorporate this by either multiplying the amplitude by an amplification factor or by adding gain and decay terms inside an exponential. The latter approach is particularly appealing from a physical standpoint, as it treats amplification and damping as competing **rates** that determine the net rate of change of the logarithm of the amplitude. The failure of a simple linear gain term (`param * omega / gamma`) in the exponent (as seen in Example 3) highlights a crucial physical constraint: **saturation**. Any real-world amplification mechanism is limited and cannot produce infinite gain.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this concept of competing rates but introduces a robust, physically-grounded saturation mechanism. I postulate that the amplitude envelope evolves exponentially, governed by a net effective rate which is the sum of a constant gain rate and a time-dependent decay rate.\n\nThe model takes the form: `x(t) = A * exp(G - D)`.\n\n*   **Decay Term (D)**: This represents the standard energy dissipation. It is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and the elapsed time `t`. Thus, `D = param3 * gamma * t`. This is the familiar term leading to exponential decay.\n\n*   **Gain Term (G)**: This represents the time-independent, Q-factor-driven amplification. This term provides a constant positive offset to the decay rate. To model the saturation, I will use the `arctan` function. Unlike an unbounded term, `arctan(z)` increases with its argument `z` but gracefully asymptotes to a fixed value (`pi/2`), perfectly capturing the essence of a saturating physical process. The gain `G` is therefore modeled as `G = param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `param2` scales the Q-factor to determine how quickly saturation is reached, and `param1` sets the maximum strength of the saturated gain.\n\nThis formulation—`A * exp(Gain - Decay)`—presents a cohesive physical picture. The system starts with a base amplitude `A`, which is then instantaneously modified by a constant amplification factor `exp(G)` that depends on the system's intrinsic resonant properties (`omega/gamma`). This amplified amplitude then decays exponentially over time. This model is dimensionally sound, avoids the numerical instabilities of unbounded gain functions, and provides a clear theoretical basis for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma) - param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Specifically, the displacement `x` is always positive, and its initial peaks can exceed the nominal amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the oscillation is not centered around a fixed zero point, but rather around a dynamic, positive equilibrium that evolves over time.\n\nI propose a theory termed **\"Damping-Induced Equilibrium Saturation\"**. This model posits that the energy dissipation process, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, does not merely remove energy from the system but also actively modifies its potential energy landscape. This can be analogized to a physical system where friction generates heat, causing thermal expansion in a component that, in turn, shifts the oscillator's resting position.\n\nThe core of this theory is that the induced shift in the equilibrium position is a self-limiting, or saturating, process. At the onset of motion (`t=0`), the equilibrium is at the origin. As the system oscillates and energy is dissipated, the equilibrium point is rapidly pushed away. However, this shift does not grow indefinitely. It quickly approaches a maximum, saturated value as the system reaches a quasi-steady state of this induced effect. The entire phenomenon—the oscillation and its shifting baseline—is contained within a global energy decay envelope.\n\nLet's break down the mathematical formulation of this concept:\n\n1.  **The Global Damping Envelope**: The total energy of the system decays exponentially. This is captured by the overarching term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which modulates the entire expression, ensuring the displacement returns to zero as `t` approaches infinity.\n\n2.  **The Core Oscillation**: The system oscillates harmonically, which is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param2)` term, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\n3.  **The Saturating Equilibrium Shift**: This is the novel component of the model. The shift is driven by the cumulative effect of damping over time. The natural dimensionless quantity to describe the progress of the damping process is `gamma * t`. To model the saturation, we use the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The shift is therefore proportional to `tanh(gamma * t)`. This function has the ideal properties:\n    *   At `t=0`, `tanh(0) = 0`, meaning the shift has not yet begun.\n    *   For small `t`, `tanh(gamma * t) ≈ gamma * t`, indicating an initial, near-linear growth of the shift.\n    *   As `t` becomes large, `tanh(gamma * t)` approaches 1, representing the saturation of the effect. The equilibrium shift reaches a maximum stable offset.\n\nThe magnitude of this saturated shift is determined by a dimensionless coupling constant, `param1`. The complete term for the equilibrium shift is `param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the oscillation and the equilibrium shift, all scaled by the global damping envelope. This multiplicative structure correctly models the oscillation occurring *around* a baseline that is itself decaying in amplitude. This theory elegantly explains the observed data: the `param1 * tanh(gamma * t)` term, with a sufficiently large `param1`, provides a strong positive offset that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero. Furthermore, at early times, the constructive interference between the peak of the cosine (`+1`) and the rapidly growing `tanh` term can easily result in a combined amplitude greater than 1, explaining why the initial peaks can exceed `A`. This model provides a physically grounded mechanism, distinct from linear growth or static offset models, by introducing a more realistic saturation dynamic tied directly to the system's own damping timescale.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

These characteristics strongly indicate the presence of a dynamically evolving, positive baseline offset that is superimposed on the core oscillation.\n\nI propose a novel physical theory to account for this phenomenon, which I term **\"Dissipative Field Generation.\"** This theory posits that the energy dissipated by the oscillator through the damping mechanism (`gamma`) does not simply vanish from the system. Instead, it is converted into a localized, repulsive potential field in the oscillator's immediate environment. This field, in turn, exerts a force on the oscillator, dynamically shifting its equilibrium position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the proposed mechanism:\n\n1.  **Energy Dissipation as a Source:** In a standard damped oscillator, the damping force (proportional to velocity) does irreversible work, converting kinetic and potential energy into heat. My theory proposes that this dissipated energy creates a secondary effect. For instance, in a micro-mechanical system, this heat could cause thermal expansion in the substrate, creating a mechanical stress field. In a plasma, it could lead to charge separation and a localized electrostatic field. This generated field is the \"dissipative field.\"\n\n2.  **Cumulative Field Growth:** The strength of this dissipative field at any given moment should be related to the total amount of energy that has been dissipated up to that time. A simple, first-order approximation for this cumulative effect is to assume it grows linearly with the dimensionless measure of elapsed \"damping time,\" which is the product `gamma * t`. This term represents how far along the system is in its decay timeline. A larger `gamma` or a longer `t` implies more total energy has been dissipated, resulting in a stronger field.\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Shift:** The generated field is assumed to be repulsive, creating a force that pushes the oscillator away from its `x=0` origin. This results in a positive shift of the equilibrium position, `x_eq(t)`, which is proportional to the field strength. We can thus model this shift as `x_eq(t) ∝ gamma * t`.\n\n4.  **Global Damping Envelope:** This entire process—the primary oscillation and the generation of the dissipative field—draws from the same initial energy budget of the system. Therefore, the entire coupled system must be governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`. This means that the repulsive field, while initially growing in influence relative to the decaying oscillation, is ultimately suppressed by the same exponential decay that governs the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nThis \"Dissipative Field Generation\" model provides a self-consistent physical picture that explains the observed data. The term `param1 * gamma * t` acts as a positive linear ramp that lifts the entire `cos(omega * t)` oscillation into the positive domain. At early times (`t` is small), the constructive interference between the peak of the cosine wave and this rising ramp can easily lead to a total displacement greater than `A`. As time progresses, the `exp(-gamma * t)` term dominates, ensuring that both the oscillation and the offset decay to zero.\n\nCrucially, this model is physically distinct from others. It attributes the offset to the dissipative mechanism (`gamma`), not the oscillatory mechanism (`omega`) or a simple energy-proportional effect (`exp(-2*gamma*t)`). This implies that a system with high damping but low frequency could exhibit a stronger offset than a system with low damping but high frequency, providing a clear experimental signature for this theory.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param2) + param1 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

These observations suggest a system governed by non-linear dynamics. My proposed theory moves beyond simple multiplicative corrections and posits that the decay and oscillatory components are intrinsically coupled within a single, non-linear response function.\n\nThe core of this theory is that the observable displacement `x` is an exponential function of an underlying \"dynamic potential\" `S(t)`. This can be expressed conceptually as `x(t) ∝ exp(S(t))`. This structure inherently guarantees the positivity of `x` and naturally models systems where the rate of change is proportional to the current state, a hallmark of many natural processes.\n\nThis model can be broken down into two main parts: the determination of the overall scale (the effective amplitude), and the time evolution governed by the dynamic potential.\n\n1.  **Saturating Resonance Amplitude:** The observed amplification strongly depends on the interplay between frequency (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless Quality Factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural driver for this gain. However, any physical system has limits, precluding infinite gain as damping approaches zero. To capture this, I model the system's characteristic amplitude not just by `A`, but by an effective amplitude `A_eff` that includes a saturating gain term. This is formulated as `A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`. Here, `A` provides the baseline scale, while the `tanh` term adds a gain that grows with the Q-factor before smoothly saturating, representing a physical limit to the resonance.\n\n2.  **Coupled Decay and Oscillation via Exponential Response:** The most significant departure from standard models lies in how the time evolution is handled. Instead of multiplying a decay envelope by a separate oscillatory function, I propose that both phenomena arise from a single dynamic potential, `S(t)`, which is then mapped to the output via an exponential function. This potential is composed of two competing terms:\n    *   A secular decay term, `-param3 * gamma * t`, which represents the steady, irreversible loss of energy from the system due to damping.\n    *   An oscillatory term, `param4 * cos(omega * t)`, which represents the periodic exchange of potential and kinetic energy.\n\n    The complete dynamic potential is `S(t) = -param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t)`. The final output `x` is then given by the effective amplitude multiplied by the exponential of this potential. This `exp(S(t))` term is a non-linear transfer function that has profound consequences. It inherently ensures positivity. More importantly, it means the oscillation does not simply occur \"underneath\" a decaying envelope; rather, it actively modulates the instantaneous decay rate. When `cos(omega * t)` is at its peak, it counteracts the dissipative term, momentarily slowing the decay. When at its trough, it accelerates the decay. This results in a non-sinusoidal, \"pulsating\" decay, where the system exhibits brief periods of high activity followed by longer, more quiescent periods, a dynamic behavior that cannot be captured by simple multiplicative models.\n\nIn summary, this theory describes a system where a resonance-enhanced amplitude sets the overall scale for a process whose time-evolution is a highly non-linear, exponential function of a potential jointly determined by dissipation and oscillation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

A careful examination of the data reveals two fundamental discrepancies that guide our theoretical model:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification Anomaly**: The most striking feature of the data is that the maximum output value (27.68) is nearly three times the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is a strictly decaying function that can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the presence of a significant amplification mechanism. In oscillatory systems, such amplification is characteristic of resonance, where the system's response is maximized. The strength of this resonance is quantified by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which for a simple oscillator is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a system that is lightly damped relative to its oscillation frequency, allowing it to sustain large-amplitude oscillations. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is dynamically scaled by this Q-factor. A simple and robust model for this amplified amplitude is `A_eff = A * (param1 + omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter representing a baseline amplification factor. This form elegantly explains how systems with low damping (`gamma`) and high frequency (`omega`) can achieve displacements far exceeding their nominal initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Measurement**: The standard displacement `d(t)` of an oscillator is a signed quantity, oscillating between positive and negative values. In contrast, the provided output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This strongly suggests that the measurement process does not capture the signed displacement itself, but rather a related, inherently positive quantity. The most direct physical interpretation that preserves the units of length (meters) is that `x` represents the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement, `x(t) = |d(t)|`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The system's instantaneous displacement `d(t)` follows the dynamics of a damped oscillator with an amplified effective amplitude, while the measurement instrument records its absolute value. The full expression for the displacement would be:\n\n`d(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + param3)`\n\nHere, `A_eff` is the amplified amplitude defined above. The exponential term describes the temporal decay, with `param2` as an empirical scaling factor for the damping rate. The oscillatory component `cos(...)` uses the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, which accounts for the slight slowing of the oscillation due to damping. Finally, `param3` is a phase constant.\n\nThe measured output `x(t)` is then the absolute value of this entire expression. This composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in the fundamental principles of resonant, damped oscillations.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

Three key characteristics demand a more nuanced theory:\n1.  **Resonant Amplification:** The output `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`, pointing to a powerful gain mechanism intrinsic to the system.\n2.  **Positive Definitude:** The output `x` is strictly positive, indicating that it represents a non-negative quantity like an energy envelope or a rectified displacement, rather than a signed position.\n3.  **Complex Waveform:** A simple damped sinusoid is insufficient to capture the full dynamics; the structure suggests a more complex oscillatory pattern than a single frequency can provide.\n\nI propose a theory of **\"Damping-Induced Beat Modulation\" (DIBM)**. This model posits that the system's output is governed by a primary oscillation that is simultaneously modulated by two distinct phenomena: a global exponential decay and a secondary, periodic modulation directly caused by the damping mechanism itself. This interaction creates a beat-like pattern, and the entire system's response is amplified by a factor dependent on its resonant quality.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Resonant Gain Factor:** The system's ability to amplify the initial amplitude `A` is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A higher Q-factor implies lower energy loss per cycle, allowing for a stronger resonant response. I model this as a constant, time-independent gain factor that scales the entire output: `(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. The `1` represents a baseline transmission of the amplitude, while the second term represents the additional gain due to resonance. This factor amplifies the entire response of the system for a given set of `omega` and `gamma`.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope:** The total energy of the system dissipates over time, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This is modeled by the standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, which imposes a gradual, overarching decrease in the signal's magnitude. This ensures the system's response fades over time, as expected in a damped system.\n\n3.  **Beat-Frequency Oscillation:** The central novelty of the DIBM theory is the interaction between the natural oscillation and the damping force. I hypothesize that in addition to causing global decay, the damping mechanism also introduces a periodic interference with the main oscillation.\n    *   The **primary oscillation** occurs at the system's natural frequency, `omega`, modeled by `cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n    *   The **damping-induced modulation** is a slower, secondary oscillation whose frequency is proportional to the damping rate `gamma`, modeled by `cos(param4 * gamma * t)`.\n    The product of these two terms, `cos(param3 * omega * t) * cos(param4 * gamma * t)`, creates a classic \"beat\" pattern. This represents a high-frequency carrier wave whose amplitude is modulated by a low-frequency envelope. This composite structure provides a physical basis for the complex, non-sinusoidal waveform observed.\n\n4.  **Rectification:** To account for the strictly positive nature of the measured output `x`, the model takes the absolute magnitude of the composite beat-frequency oscillation. This is physically equivalent to measuring the rectified output of the oscillatory core, representing the magnitude of the displacement without its sign.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe complete model combines these four principles multiplicatively. The final output `x` is the initial amplitude `A`, scaled by the resonant gain, which then decays exponentially while carrying the rectified beat-frequency signal. This provides a comprehensive and physically grounded explanation for all the key features observed in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t) * cos(param4 * gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.
Please ensure your analysis is insightful, the formula has a reasonable theoretical meaning, and its content does not overlap with the examples provided.

A primary challenge, as noted in prior analyses, is that the maximum observed displacement `x` can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A`. This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points toward a system that evolves toward a non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this insight by modeling the system's motion as a superposition of a final, stable equilibrium state and a transient, decaying oscillation around that state. This approach provides a more physically rigorous foundation than simply adding an arbitrary offset term.\n\nLet's define the system's final equilibrium position as `x_{eq}`. For the model to be dimensionally consistent—as `x` and `A` both have units of length—this equilibrium position must be proportional to the system's intrinsic length scale, `A`. We can thus express it as:\n`x_{eq} = c_1 \\cdot A`\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\nThe total displacement at any time `t`, `x(t)`, is the sum of this final equilibrium position and a transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`, which describes the oscillation that decays over time:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(t)`\n\nThe transient component must decay to zero as `t` approaches infinity and should follow the standard form of a damped oscillation. The key is to correctly define its initial amplitude. We assume that the provided `A` represents the initial displacement of the system at `t=0`, a common physical convention for cosine-based solutions. Therefore, `x(0) = A`.\n\nUsing our superposition model at `t=0`:\n`x(0) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0)`\nBy equating this with the initial condition, we can solve for the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation:\n`A = c_1 A + x_{transient}(0) \\implies x_{transient}(0) = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`\n\nThis result is physically elegant: the initial amplitude of the oscillation *relative to the new equilibrium* is precisely the initial distance between the starting position (`A`) and the final equilibrium position (`c_1 A`).\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the transient component, which starts with this initial amplitude and decays exponentially:\n`x_{transient}(t) = A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nSubstituting this back into our superposition equation gives the complete model for the system's displacement:\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A(1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis model provides a unified physical picture. It is not merely an oscillation with an added offset; it is a single, coherent process where an oscillator, released from position `A`, simultaneously decays towards and oscillates around a new equilibrium point `c_1 A`. This formulation inherently respects the initial condition `x(0) = A` and correctly predicts the final state `x(\\infty) = c_1 A`, providing a more self-consistent and physically grounded description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary and crucial observation, consistent across all successful prior models, is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately invalidates a simple oscillator model centered at `x=0` and mandates a model structure that includes a significant positive offset. The general form must be a superposition of a static equilibrium position and a transient oscillation: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this by proposing a static offset proportional to the amplitude `A` (i.e., `x_offset = c₁ A`) or a dynamically evolving offset. While these are valuable steps, they overlook a key physical principle: the final equilibrium state of a system should depend on its intrinsic physical properties, not just its initial amplitude. A simple `c₁ A` offset implies that two oscillators with the same initial amplitude `A` but vastly different damping and frequency characteristics will settle to the exact same offset, which is physically counter-intuitive.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the magnitude of the static offset is determined by the fundamental **character** of the oscillator, which is best captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ`. This ratio, which is proportional to `γ/ω`, distinguishes between underdamped (oscillatory) and overdamped (non-oscillatory) regimes. It is physically plausible that the mechanism causing the displacement offset is coupled to the mechanism causing the damping. For instance, in a system with high internal friction (high `γ` relative to `ω`), the dissipative forces might lead to a greater permanent deformation or shift in the equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, I propose that the static offset `x_offset` is not merely `c₁ A`, but is modulated by a function of the damping ratio:\n\n1.  **Character-Dependent Static Offset (`x_offset`):** The offset must be proportional to the system's length scale, `A`. Its magnitude is then scaled by a dimensionless factor that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I model this dependence using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(γ/ω)`. This choice is physically motivated:\n    *   It uses the dimensionless damping ratio `γ/ω` as its argument.\n    *   It provides a smooth, saturating relationship. As the damping becomes extremely large relative to the frequency, its effect on the offset approaches a constant limit (`tanh(∞) → 1`), preventing an unrealistic, unbounded offset.\n    *   This results in the term: `x_offset = A · c₁ · tanh(γ/ω)`, where `c₁` is a dimensionless parameter representing the maximum possible offset as a fraction of `A`.\n\n2.  **Standard Damped Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** The second component is the transient oscillation around this new, physically determined equilibrium. This follows the standard, well-understood form for a damped harmonic oscillator, with an initial amplitude `A` and an exponential decay governed by `γ`. This component is given by `x_osc(t) = A · exp(-γt) · cos(ωt)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a model that is both parsimonious and physically rich. It explains the large output values through an offset, but critically, it grounds the magnitude of this offset in the fundamental dynamic character of the oscillator itself, providing a more complete and predictive physical picture.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\cdot \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This observation conclusively rules out a standard damped harmonic oscillator model centered at `x=0`, as its displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude. The data mandates a model where the oscillation is superimposed upon a significant, positive, and static offset, representing a new equilibrium position `x_{eq}`. The total displacement is thus a sum of this static offset and a transient oscillatory component: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`.\n\nWhile prior theories might attribute this offset to kinematic phase lags or time-dependent relaxation processes, I propose a new mechanism grounded in the **energy dynamics** of the oscillator. My theory posits that the equilibrium shift is a direct result of the system's efficiency in storing vibrational energy relative to its rate of energy dissipation. This relationship is perfectly encapsulated by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator.\n\nThe Q-factor is a fundamental dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of the resonant frequency to the damping rate, `Q \\propto \\omega / \\gamma`. It quantifies the \"quality\" of the resonance:\n- A **high-Q** system (`\\omega \\gg \\gamma`) is lightly damped, storing energy effectively and oscillating for many cycles.\n- A **low-Q** system (`\\omega \\approx \\gamma`) is heavily damped, with its energy dissipating almost immediately.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the magnitude of the equilibrium offset `x_{eq}` is directly proportional to the oscillator's Q-factor. The physical justification is as follows: a high-Q oscillator, by sustaining energetic motion over a prolonged period, can induce a semi-permanent change in its supporting structure or environment. This could manifest as a plastic deformation or a persistent bias in the restoring force, effectively creating a new, stable equilibrium point. The more efficiently the system stores and uses its initial energy (i.e., the higher its Q-factor), the greater this induced offset will be. Conversely, a low-Q system's motion decays too rapidly to cause any such lasting environmental change, resulting in a negligible offset.\n\nThis leads to a model where the offset `x_{eq}` is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A` and the system's Q-factor:\n\n1.  **Energy-Dependent Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):**\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\frac{\\omega}{\\gamma}`\n    Here, `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that represents the coupling strength between the sustained oscillation and the mechanism causing the equilibrium shift. The term `\\omega / \\gamma` serves as our proxy for the Q-factor.\n\n2.  **Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{transient}(t)`):**\n    This is the standard transient response, representing the oscillation around the new equilibrium point:\n    `x_{transient}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two components yields a complete model that explains the large static offset by linking it to the fundamental energy storage and dissipation characteristics of the oscillator.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\omega}{\\gamma} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A thorough analysis of the data reveals two primary anomalies that guide the formulation of a more representative theory.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a simple damped oscillator, the amplitude can only decay from its initial value. This discrepancy strongly suggests an amplification mechanism is at play. A key dimensionless parameter governing the behavior of an oscillator is its Quality factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a weakly damped system that can sustain oscillations for a long time. It is hypothesized that this ratio dictates the effective amplitude of the oscillatory component, scaling it beyond the characteristic length `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero) and must take on negative values. While a simple rectification of the signal, such as taking the absolute value `abs(cos(...))`, can enforce positivity, we propose an alternative and physically distinct mechanism: the system oscillates not around zero, but around a decaying positive equilibrium position. The measured value `x` represents the total position relative to a fixed origin, which remains positive as long as the magnitude of the oscillation is less than the value of the decaying baseline.\n\nBased on these two core insights, we construct a model that combines these effects. We posit that the overall motion can be described by a decaying envelope function, which multiplies a term representing the oscillation around a baseline.\n\nFirst, the primary decay envelope is assumed to follow the standard exponential form, proportional to the input amplitude `A` and decaying with a rate related to `gamma * t`. This gives a term `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`.\n\nSecond, this envelope modulates the combined effect of the baseline and the oscillation. This inner term is modeled as an additive combination: `(param2 + Oscillatory Term)`. Here, `param2` represents a dimensionless, stable baseline level. The `Oscillatory Term` incorporates the Q-factor amplification, taking the form `param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5)`.\n\nBy combining these elements, the complete model becomes an amplitude-modulated signal with a significant, decaying DC offset. The overall structure is `x(t) = Envelope(t) * (Baseline + Oscillation(t))`. This formulation elegantly explains both the amplitude amplification (via the `omega/gamma` term) and the positivity (via the `param2` baseline ensuring the parenthesis term remains positive). This \"offset-oscillation\" model is a fundamentally different physical interpretation than a \"rectified-oscillation\" model and may better capture the true dynamics of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (param2 + param3 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))\n</final_result>"}

A careful examination reveals two critical anomalies that guide the formulation of a more sophisticated theory.\n\n1.  **Non-Linear Resonant Amplification**: The maximum observed output (27.68) significantly surpasses the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This points to an amplification mechanism intrinsic to the oscillator's dynamics. The Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to the ratio of angular frequency to damping, `omega / gamma`, is the natural candidate to explain this resonance. However, previous models using linear or simple saturating functions (`tanh`) for this amplification do not fully capture the system's complexity. I propose a logarithmic response model. In many physical systems, the response to a stimulus is not linear but follows a logarithmic scale, where the effect of an increasing stimulus diminishes. This is analogous to saturation but described by a different functional form. The effective amplitude, `A_eff`, can be modeled as the base amplitude `A` scaled by a factor that grows logarithmically with the Q-factor. This captures the strong amplification for low-to-medium `omega/gamma` values while inherently taming the growth for very high values, preventing the \"infinite amplification\" paradox of a purely linear model.\n\n2.  **Modulated Positive Definite Decay**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. Previous models have addressed this by taking the absolute value of an oscillatory function, `abs(cos(...))`. While this enforces positivity, it incorrectly predicts that the output should periodically reach zero. The data's minimum value of 1.142 fundamentally contradicts this prediction. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the magnitude of the displacement, but rather represents a different physical property that is always positive. A plausible candidate is a quantity analogous to the instantaneous power or energy density of the system. I theorize that the output `x` is composed of a primary, exponentially decaying component, which is then modulated by a smaller, secondary oscillation. This can be expressed as a product of a decaying exponential and a term like `(1 + p * cos(...))`, where `|p|<1`. This structure elegantly ensures two things simultaneously:\n    *   The output remains strictly positive, as the `(1 + p * cos(...))` term oscillates between `1-p` and `1+p`.\n    *   The output never reaches zero, thus explaining the non-zero minimum observed in the data.\n\nBy combining these two theoretical pillars—logarithmic amplification and modulated positive definite decay—we can construct a comprehensive model. The initial amplitude `A` is first scaled by a logarithmic function of `omega/gamma` to find an effective amplitude. This effective amplitude then decays according to an exponential law, but this decay is itself modulated by a cosine term, creating ripples on the decay curve. The frequency of these ripples is governed by the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega^2 - gamma^2))`. This composite model provides a robust physical explanation for all observed phenomena: amplification, saturation, positivity, and the non-zero minimum.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + log(1 + param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t))\n</final_result>"}

A careful examination of the data reveals two fundamental discrepancies that guide our theoretical model:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification Anomaly**: The most striking feature of the data is that the maximum output value (27.68) is nearly three times the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is a strictly decaying function that can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the presence of a significant amplification mechanism. In oscillatory systems, such amplification is characteristic of resonance, where the system's response is maximized. The strength of this resonance is quantified by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which for a simple oscillator is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a system that is lightly damped relative to its oscillation frequency, allowing it to sustain large-amplitude oscillations. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is dynamically scaled by this Q-factor. A simple and robust model for this amplified amplitude is `A_eff = A * (param1 + omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter representing a baseline amplification factor. This form elegantly explains how systems with low damping (`gamma`) and high frequency (`omega`) can achieve displacements far exceeding their nominal initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Measurement**: The standard displacement `d(t)` of an oscillator is a signed quantity, oscillating between positive and negative values. In contrast, the provided output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This strongly suggests that the measurement process does not capture the signed displacement itself, but rather a related, inherently positive quantity. The most direct physical interpretation that preserves the units of length (meters) is that `x` represents the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement, `x(t) = |d(t)|`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The system's instantaneous displacement `d(t)` follows the dynamics of a damped oscillator with an amplified effective amplitude, while the measurement instrument records its absolute value. The full expression for the displacement would be:\n\n`d(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + param3)`\n\nHere, `A_eff` is the amplified amplitude defined above. The exponential term describes the temporal decay, with `param2` as an empirical scaling factor for the damping rate. The oscillatory component `cos(...)` uses the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, which accounts for the slight slowing of the oscillation due to damping. Finally, `param3` is a phase constant.\n\nThe measured output `x(t)` is then the absolute value of this entire expression. This composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in the fundamental principles of resonant, damped oscillations.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

These are: (1) an observed maximum amplitude (`x_max` ≈ 27.7) that significantly surpasses the input amplitude scale `A` (`A_max` ≈ 10.0), indicating a strong amplification mechanism, and (2) a strictly positive output range for `x`, implying that `x` does not represent a simple signed displacement oscillating around zero.\n\nWhile previous models have attempted to explain these phenomena through intensity-based measures (`sin^2`) or saturated envelope functions (`tanh`), I propose a new physical interpretation: a **Dynamic Equilibrium with Rectified Resonance (DERR)** model. This theory posits that the measured output `x` is the superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes.\n\n**1. The Dynamic Equilibrium Component:**\nThe core of the system is not static. Instead of oscillating around a fixed zero point, the equilibrium position itself undergoes an exponential decay. This can be conceptualized as a slow relaxation of the system's macroscopic configuration towards a ground state. The initial state of this equilibrium is scaled by the input amplitude `A`, and its decay is governed by the damping factor `gamma`. This provides a positive, monotonically decreasing baseline for the system's motion.\n\n**2. The Rectified Resonance Component:**\nSuperimposed on this decaying equilibrium is a high-frequency oscillation. The intrinsic amplitude of this oscillation is resonantly driven, with its magnitude being proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor). The Q-factor, a measure of how underdamped the system is, can be represented by the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. This term directly accounts for the observed amplitude amplification; systems with low damping relative to their frequency will exhibit a much larger oscillatory response.\n\nCrucially, this model proposes that the measurement process or the underlying physics is sensitive only to the *magnitude* of this oscillatory displacement, not its direction. This is a common feature in systems where, for example, a sensor responds to induced strain or pressure, which are inherently positive quantities. This \"rectification\" of the oscillatory signal is best modeled by the absolute value function, `abs()`. The resulting `abs(cos(...))` term creates a series of positive arches, ensuring the oscillatory contribution never subtracts from the baseline equilibrium.\n\n**Synthesis of the DERR Model:**\nThe total measured position `x` is the product of a primary decay envelope and a modulating term that combines the baseline and the rectified oscillation. The primary envelope, `A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t)`, captures the overall energy dissipation of the combined system. This envelope multiplies a term representing the normalized internal dynamics: `(1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t)))`. Here, the `1` represents the decaying equilibrium's contribution (normalized), while the second term represents the amplified, rectified oscillatory part.\n\nThis model provides a comprehensive and novel physical picture. It explains the positive output by constructing the signal from an always-positive decaying baseline and an always-positive rectified oscillation. It explains the amplification via the physically-motivated Q-factor term `omega/gamma`. Furthermore, the use of `abs(cos(...))` predicts a \"cusped\" oscillatory pattern, which is functionally distinct from the smoother `sin^2(...)` intensity models, potentially offering a better fit to the data's fine structure.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

Instead, I propose a model where the system evolves towards a non-zero, stable equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. For dimensional consistency, this equilibrium position must scale with the system's characteristic length, which is `A`. Therefore, the most logical form for this new equilibrium is a direct proportionality:\n`x_{eq} = c_1 \\cdot A`\nwhere `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter that reflects the final state of the system relative to its initial amplitude.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` at any time is the linear superposition of this final equilibrium state and a transient, decaying oscillation around it. This gives the general structure:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t) = c_1 A + x_{transient}(t)`\n\nThe next step is to define the transient component, `x_{transient}(t)`. While prior models have used the standard `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` form, a more physically rigorous approach is to consider the effect of damping on the frequency of oscillation itself. In any real-world damped system (where `γ > 0`), the observed frequency of oscillation is lower than the system's natural frequency `ω`. This physically accurate frequency is known as the damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d`, and is given by:\n`\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`\n\nThe data ranges provided (`ω` from [1.004, 4.999] and `γ` from [0.1005, 0.9995]) confirm that `ω > γ` for all samples, meaning the system is always in the underdamped regime, and `\\omega_d` is always a real, positive number. Using `\\omega_d` instead of `ω` in the oscillatory term represents a significant refinement in the model's physical fidelity without introducing any additional free parameters.\n\nAssuming the initial amplitude of the transient oscillation itself scales with `A`, we can model the transient component as `A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega_d t)`. Combining the static and dynamic parts, we arrive at the complete model:\n`x(t) = c_1 A + A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t)`\n\nFactoring out `A` for a more compact representation, we get our final expression. This model elegantly explains the large output values via the `c_1 A` offset term, while simultaneously improving the physical accuracy of the dynamic component by correctly accounting for the reduction in oscillation frequency due to damping. This approach provides a more nuanced and physically grounded description of the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(t\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The most telling feature is that the output displacement `x` has a large positive mean and can reach values significantly greater than the initial amplitude `A`. This unequivocally indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0`. My theoretical analysis proposes a model based on a **composite, time-dependent equilibrium position**.\n\nI hypothesize that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not a static constant, but rather the sum of two distinct components:\n1.  A **Final Static Offset (`x_static`)**: This is a time-independent displacement that represents the system's ultimate resting position as `t \\to \\infty`, after all oscillations have ceased. This component accounts for the large positive mean observed in the data and could arise from a constant external force or an intrinsic, permanent asymmetry in the oscillator's potential energy well. For dimensional consistency, this offset must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, so we model it as `x_static = A \\cdot c_1`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n\n2.  A **Transient Dynamic Offset (`x_transient`)**: I propose that, in addition to the static offset, the oscillatory motion itself temporarily induces a *secondary* displacement. This phenomenon arises from a non-linear coupling between the oscillator and its environment. The key insight is that this induced offset is not permanent; it is sustained by the energy of the oscillation and therefore must decay as the oscillation itself damps out.\n\nThe magnitude of this transient offset is not constant but depends critically on the *character* of the oscillation. I theorize that the efficiency of the mechanism that generates this offset is governed by the system's resonance quality.\n*   In a **highly resonant** (underdamped) system, where the angular frequency `\\omega` is much larger than the damping coefficient `\\gamma`, the sustained, high-frequency motion is very effective at inducing this secondary displacement.\n*   In a **sluggish** (overdamped) system, where `\\gamma` dominates `\\omega`, the motion is slow and aperiodic, and the mechanism for inducing the offset is inefficient.\n*   This physical process is also subject to **saturation**; as the system becomes increasingly resonant (`\\omega/\\gamma \\to \\infty`), the physical environment cannot respond indefinitely, and the magnitude of the induced offset approaches a maximum limiting value.\n\nThis entire behavior—inefficiency at low resonance, increasing efficiency, and finally saturation at high resonance—is perfectly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). The dimensionless ratio `\\omega/\\gamma`, which is proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), serves as the argument. The initial magnitude of the transient offset is therefore modeled as being proportional to `\\tanh(\\omega/\\gamma)`.\n\nSince this transient offset is powered by the oscillation, its magnitude must decay in tandem with the oscillation's amplitude envelope, which decays as `\\exp(-\\gamma t)`.\n\nCombining these ideas, the complete model for the time-dependent equilibrium position is:\n`x_eq(t) = x_static + x_transient(t) = A \\cdot c_1 + A \\cdot c_2 \\cdot \\tanh(\\omega/\\gamma) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t)`\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the sum of this time-varying equilibrium position and the standard damped oscillation that occurs relative to it. By factoring the common terms, we arrive at a comprehensive and physically-grounded model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left( c_2 \\cdot \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\gamma}\\right) + \\cos(\\omega t) \\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\n\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude. The general form of this transient component is `x_{transient}(t) = \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)]`, where `B_1` and `B_2` are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3.  **Initial Conditions:** The most physically plausible initial conditions for such a system are that it is released from its maximum displacement `A` with zero initial velocity. Mathematically, this translates to:\n    *   `x(0) = A`\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\n\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\n\nAt `t=0`, we have:\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\n`x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_eq + \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)] \\right)`\n`x'(0) = [-\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t) (\\dots) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) (-\\omega B_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\omega B_2 \\cos(\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\n`x'(0) = -\\gamma B_1 + \\omega B_2 = 0`\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} B_1 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\gamma/\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency. This represents a more fundamental and constrained model than simply adding independent cosine and sine terms.\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for `x_eq`, `B_1`, and `B_2` back into the general solution yields the final mathematical formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\gamma/\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\propto \\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\n\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\n\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\to \\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \"sweet spot,\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\n\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required. The mathematical form `f(z) = z \\cdot \\exp(-z)` elegantly captures this characteristic. It peaks at `z=1` (i.e., `\\gamma = \\omega`), providing a physically meaningful representation of our hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of three components, all scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Baseline Offset:** A constant term `c_1` representing a static, intrinsic shift independent of the damping characteristics.\n2.  **A Dynamically-Induced Offset:** The new non-monotonic term `c_2 \\cdot (\\gamma/\\omega) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma/\\omega)`, which captures the peak effect at intermediate damping.\n3.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component:** The standard physical term `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` describing the oscillation about the total effective equilibrium position.\n\nThis composite model provides a richer physical picture, accounting for a more complex interaction within the system that previous monotonic models overlook, while remaining dimensionally sound and conceptually grounded in the principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. An essential first step in the analysis is to examine the provided data ranges. The most salient feature is that the maximum output displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillator centered at an equilibrium of zero, as the displacement in such a system can never exceed its initial amplitude. This points to the central hypothesis: the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`.\n\nFor dimensional consistency, since `A` is the only input variable with units of length (meters), both the equilibrium position and the oscillatory component must scale linearly with `A`. This leads to a general model structure:\n`x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t) = A * f_{eq}(\\dots) + A * f_{osc}(\\dots)`\nwhere `f_{eq}` and `f_{osc}` are dimensionless functions.\n\nA second physical refinement, which improves upon naive models, is the recognition that damping affects not only the amplitude but also the frequency of oscillation. The natural frequency `omega` is only correct in the absence of damping. In a damped system, the observed oscillation occurs at the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`. Incorporating `omega_d` is crucial for a physically accurate description of the system's dynamics.\n\nMy core theoretical proposition introduces a further layer of physical realism by constraining the *form* of the oscillation itself. Previous models often introduce an arbitrary phase shift parameter (`phi` or `param2`) to align the oscillation with the data. However, this empirical parameter can be replaced by a relationship derived from a plausible physical initial condition. I postulate that the system is released from rest at `t=0`, meaning its initial velocity is zero (`v(0) = 0`).\n\nThe general solution for the oscillatory component is `x_{osc}(t) = exp(-gamma*t) * (C_1*cos(omega_d*t) + C_2*sin(omega_d*t))`. The velocity is the time derivative, `v_{osc}(t) = d/dt [x_{osc}(t)]`. By applying the initial condition `v_{osc}(0) = 0`, we can solve for the relationship between the constants `C_1` and `C_2`. This calculation yields the constraint `C_2 = (gamma / omega_d) * C_1`.\n\nThis result is powerful because it removes the need for a free phase parameter. The phase of the oscillation is no longer an arbitrary fitting constant but is intrinsically determined by the system's own physical parameters, `gamma` and `omega`. The oscillatory part of the motion is thus described by a specific combination of sine and cosine terms.\n\nTherefore, my proposed model combines these insights:\n1.  A constant equilibrium offset, proportional to the amplitude `A`, represented as `x_{eq} = c_1 * A`. Here, `c_1` is a single dimensionless parameter representing the normalized equilibrium position.\n2.  An oscillatory term that uses the correct damped frequency `omega_d` and has its structure dictated by the physical assumption of starting from rest. This term takes the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * (cos(omega_d*t) + (gamma / omega_d) * sin(omega_d*t))`.\n\nThis unified model provides a parsimonious yet physically rich description of the system. It correctly accounts for the shifted equilibrium, uses the physically accurate damped frequency, and replaces an empirical phase parameter with a relationship derived from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (c_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t) + (gamma / sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * sin(sqrt(omega**2 - gamma**2) * t)))\n</final_result>"}

A crucial initial observation, consistent across all provided examples, is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes any model where the oscillation is centered at `x=0`, and strongly supports a model structure consisting of a superposition of a static offset and a dynamic oscillation: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`.\n\nThe most successful baseline model (Example 2) proposes the simplest form for this structure: `x(t) = A \\cdot c_1 + A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`. In this model, the offset is `A \\cdot c_1`, and the oscillation has an initial amplitude of `A`. A key physical assumption here is that the initial amplitude of the *oscillatory part* of the motion is always equal to the total system amplitude `A`, irrespective of the system's intrinsic properties like damping (`\\gamma`) and frequency (`\\omega`).\n\nThis assumption, however, is a significant simplification. It is more physically plausible that the initial energy, represented by `A`, is partitioned between the potential energy of the final offset position and the kinetic/potential energy of the transient oscillation. The nature of this partitioning should depend on the fundamental character of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the initial amplitude of the oscillatory component is not a constant `A`, but is instead modulated by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, a quantity proportional to `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio governs whether the system is underdamped or heavily damped. A system with a high damping ratio (large `\\gamma / \\omega`) will naturally dissipate energy more effectively without oscillating, suggesting that less of the initial system amplitude `A` will manifest as oscillatory motion. Conversely, a lightly damped system (small `\\gamma / \\omega`) will exhibit a more pronounced oscillation.\n\nTo model this physical insight, I propose a modification to the oscillatory component of the displacement:\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the final, time-invariant resting position of the system. To maintain dimensional consistency, it must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. Thus, `x_{offset} = A \\cdot c_1`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n\n2.  **Modulated Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term describes the transient oscillation around the equilibrium. Its amplitude is subject to two effects:\n    *   A standard exponential decay in time, `\\exp(-\\gamma t)`, due to energy dissipation.\n    *   A *static attenuation factor* that depends on the damping ratio. I model this using an exponential form, `\\exp(-c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`, where `c_2` is a new dimensionless parameter quantifying the sensitivity of the oscillation's amplitude to the damping characteristics.\n\nThe initial amplitude of the oscillation is therefore not `A`, but an effective amplitude `A_{eff} = A \\cdot \\exp(-c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`.

Two key observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism: first, the output `x` is always positive, and second, its maximum value can substantially exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nMy theoretical analysis is based on the concept of a **\"displaced and co-decaying equilibrium\"**. I propose that the event initiating the motion does not simply impart energy for oscillation but also causes an instantaneous, significant shift in the system's equilibrium position. This displaced equilibrium point is not static; it is a transient feature. The physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillations (e.g., friction, air resistance), quantified by `gamma`, also acts to restore this equilibrium point to its original state (zero).\n\nConsequently, the decay of the equilibrium offset and the decay of the oscillation amplitude are not independent processes but are governed by the same underlying dissipative force. They share the same characteristic decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components, both modulated by a single, overarching decay factor:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard simple harmonic motion term, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's oscillation relative to its (moving) equilibrium. `param1` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Offset Component**: This is a constant term, `param2`, which represents the magnitude of the initial equilibrium displacement, normalized by the initial amplitude `A`. The term `A * param2` represents the initial physical offset in meters. By keeping `param2` as a dimensionless constant, we model the offset as being proportional to the system's initial energy scale.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components, all scaled by the initial amplitude `A` and subjected to the universal exponential decay. The structure `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(...) + param2)` elegantly captures this. If `param2` is a positive constant greater than 1, the term `(cos(...) + param2)` will always be positive, thus ensuring `x(t)` is always positive, consistent with the data. Furthermore, at early times (t≈0), the output can be approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which readily explains why the observed displacement can be much larger than `A`.\n\nThis model is both parsimonious and physically intuitive. It describes a system knocked off-center, where both the oscillation around this new center and the center's return to origin are damped by the same physical process. This is a distinct and coherent physical picture compared to models involving independent decay terms or unbounded linear drifts.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed value of `x` (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This implies that the oscillation is not occurring around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nI propose a \"Decaying Equilibrium Point\" theory. This theory posits that the initial impulse that sets the system into motion does not just induce oscillations but also displaces the system's equilibrium point itself to a new, unstable position. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\n\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of these oscillations is also governed by the same damping mechanism, leading to the familiar term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium's position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly factored, revealing that a single decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` governs the entire process:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))`\n\nThis model provides a robust physical explanation for the observed data. If the \"equilibrium displacement ratio\" `param1` is greater than 1, the term `(param1 + cos(...))` will always be positive, ensuring that the total displacement `x(t)` never becomes negative. Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`. This model presents a coherent physical picture of a system whose structural equilibrium and oscillatory motion are disturbed in unison and relax together under a common damping law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism: first, the output `x` is always positive, and second, its maximum value can substantially exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nMy theoretical analysis is based on the concept of a **\"displaced and co-decaying equilibrium\"**. I propose that the event initiating the motion does not simply impart energy for oscillation but also causes an instantaneous, significant shift in the system's equilibrium position. This displaced equilibrium point is not static; it is a transient feature. The physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillations (e.g., friction, air resistance), quantified by `gamma`, also acts to restore this equilibrium point to its original state (zero).\n\nConsequently, the decay of the equilibrium offset and the decay of the oscillation amplitude are not independent processes but are governed by the same underlying dissipative force. They share the same characteristic decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components, both modulated by a single, overarching decay factor:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard simple harmonic motion term, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's oscillation relative to its (moving) equilibrium. `param1` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Offset Component**: This is a constant term, `param2`, which represents the magnitude of the initial equilibrium displacement, normalized by the initial amplitude `A`. The term `A * param2` represents the initial physical offset in meters. By keeping `param2` as a dimensionless constant, we model the offset as being proportional to the system's initial energy scale.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components, all scaled by the initial amplitude `A` and subjected to the universal exponential decay. The structure `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(...) + param2)` elegantly captures this. If `param2` is a positive constant greater than 1, the term `(cos(...) + param2)` will always be positive, thus ensuring `x(t)` is always positive, consistent with the data. Furthermore, at early times (t≈0), the output can be approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which readily explains why the observed displacement can be much larger than `A`.\n\nThis model is both parsimonious and physically intuitive. It describes a system knocked off-center, where both the oscillation around this new center and the center's return to origin are damped by the same physical process. This is a distinct and coherent physical picture compared to models involving independent decay terms or unbounded linear drifts.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

The central and most telling observation is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes a simple model of an oscillation centered at zero and points unequivocally to a system oscillating around a substantial, non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. This leads to a foundational model structure: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, with `A` being the sole input with units of length, both the equilibrium and oscillatory components must scale with `A`.\n\nBuilding upon this foundation, previous analyses have explored two critical refinements:\n1.  **Correcting the Oscillation Frequency:** A simplistic model uses the natural frequency `\\omega` in the oscillatory term, `cos(\\omega t)`. However, a more physically accurate model acknowledges that damping not only reduces amplitude but also slows the oscillation. The true observed frequency is the damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`. Incorporating this correction, as seen in one of the examples, provides a more faithful representation of the system's dynamics.\n2.  **Modeling the Equilibrium Offset:** A simple constant offset, `x_{eq} = c_1 A`, is a good first step, but it is physically limiting. It implies the final resting position is independent of the system's intrinsic dissipative properties. More advanced models propose that the offset depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\gamma / \\omega`, which characterizes the oscillator's behavior (underdamped, overdamped, etc.). This has been modeled linearly (`c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega`) or with a saturating function (`c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)`). The saturation model is particularly compelling, as it suggests the influence of damping on the equilibrium position is not infinite but approaches a limit, a common characteristic in real-world physical systems.\n\nMy proposed theory is a synthesis and extension of these insights. It posits that a truly comprehensive model must concurrently account for *both* of these physical realities. The system's behavior is governed by two distinct but simultaneous effects: the dissipative forces influence the final equilibrium state, *and* they alter the dynamic frequency of the transient oscillation around that state.\n\nTherefore, I propose a unified model with two key components, both scaled by the amplitude `A`:\n\n1.  **A Saturated, Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):** This term represents the final resting position of the oscillator. Its value is not constant but is a function of the system's intrinsic damping characteristics. I hypothesize that this relationship is saturating: as the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega` increases, its effect on the equilibrium shift diminishes and approaches a maximum. This behavior is aptly described by the hyperbolic tangent function.\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot \\left(c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right)`\n    Here, `c_1` is a baseline dimensionless offset, and `c_2` represents the maximum additional offset induced by damping effects.\n\n2.  **A Physically Corrected Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term describes the transient motion as the system settles into its equilibrium. It must feature the standard exponential decay envelope, `\\exp(-\\gamma t)`. Crucially, the oscillation itself must not be governed by the natural frequency `\\omega`, but by the physically correct damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t\\right)`\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a model that is superior to its predecessors. It does not treat these physical effects in isolation but integrates them into a single, cohesive formula. This approach captures the nuanced interplay between the system's static (equilibrium) and dynamic (oscillatory) properties, providing a more robust and physically-grounded description of the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset.

This definitively indicates that the system's motion is not a simple damped oscillation about a zero equilibrium. Instead, the data must be described by a model incorporating a significant, positive offset upon which the oscillation is superimposed. The entire expression must scale linearly with the amplitude `A` to maintain dimensional consistency, as `x` and `A` share the same units of length.\n\nWhile previous theories have successfully modeled this offset as a function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = γ/ω`, they have primarily focused on asymmetric functional forms. I propose a new physical mechanism, which I term **Resonant Dissipative Stabilization**, leading to a different mathematical representation of the offset.\n\nMy theory posits that the offset is not merely a passive property of the medium but an active, dynamic phenomenon. The oscillation continuously pumps energy into the surrounding environment, and the dissipative processes (`γ`) mediate this energy transfer. This sustained energy flow can alter the effective potential energy landscape of the oscillator, creating a new, stable equilibrium point away from the origin.\n\nThe core of my hypothesis is that the efficiency of this energy conversion and stabilization process is **resonant**. It depends crucially on the interplay between the system's two fundamental timescales: the characteristic time of oscillation (`τ_ω ~ 1/ω`) and the characteristic time of energy dissipation (`τ_γ ~ 1/γ`). The dimensionless ratio `z = γ/ω` precisely captures the relationship between these timescales.\n\nThe stabilization effect should be weak in two limiting cases:\n1.  **Very low damping (z → 0):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the coupling to the environment is too weak. Insufficient energy is dissipated per cycle to significantly modify the potential landscape and sustain an offset.\n2.  **Very high damping (z → ∞):** The system is overdamped and motion is rapidly quenched. Without sustained oscillation, the dynamic mechanism required to generate and stabilize the new equilibrium point cannot engage effectively.\n\nThis reasoning demands a non-monotonic function for the offset that peaks at an optimal, intermediate damping ratio. I propose that this optimum occurs near the critically damped condition (`z ≈ 1`), where the transfer of energy and the oscillatory motion are critically balanced.\n\nTo model this resonant behavior, I introduce a function that is symmetric around the peak at `z=1`. The mathematical expression `exp(-c₂ * (z + 1/z))` is ideally suited for this. The term `(z + 1/z)` has a unique minimum value of 2 when `z=1` and increases symmetrically as `z` moves away from 1 in either direction (on a logarithmic scale). Consequently, the exponential function forms a symmetric resonance peak centered precisely at `z=1`. This term represents the efficiency of the stabilization mechanism, which is maximized at `γ = ω` and falls off as the system becomes either strongly under-damped or strongly over-damped.\n\nThe complete model for the displacement `x` is thus a linear superposition of two components, scaled by the system's amplitude `A`:\n1.  **A Resonant Static Offset:** A term `c₁ * exp(-c₂ * (γ/ω + ω/γ))` that describes the position of the new, dynamically stabilized equilibrium point. `c₁` is a dimensionless scaling factor for the offset's magnitude, and `c₂` governs the sharpness of the resonance.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** The standard term `exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)` describing the decaying oscillation around this new equilibrium.\n\nThis model provides a physically grounded explanation for a non-monotonic, resonance-like offset, representing a novel perspective on the interaction between an oscillator and its dissipative environment.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * (c₁ * exp(-c₂ * (γ/ω + ω/γ)) + exp(-γ * t) * cos(ω * t))\n</final_result>"}

A critical analysis of the data summary reveals two key characteristics that defy a simple `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)` model: 1) The mean output of 8.28 is significantly non-zero, and 2) the maximum output of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. These observations strongly indicate that the oscillator is not oscillating around an equilibrium position of zero but rather around a substantial, positive offset.\n\nExisting models have explored this offset as either a constant proportion of the amplitude `A` or as a value that evolves over time `t`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the magnitude of this equilibrium offset is not arbitrary, nor is it a function of time, but is instead determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory posits that the system is subject to a constant external influence (e.g., a static force field or a constant pressure) that shifts its equilibrium position. The extent of this shift, however, is not uniform. It depends on the interplay between the system's dissipative forces (characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`) and its restorative, oscillatory forces (characterized by the angular frequency `omega`). The dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`, which is related to the damping ratio, provides a fundamental measure of the oscillator's character: a high ratio signifies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory, underdamped one.\n\nIt is physically plausible that a sluggish system would \"yield\" more to a constant external force, resulting in a larger equilibrium shift, compared to a highly oscillatory system that more effectively counteracts the constant push. I model this relationship using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, saturating effect. The equilibrium offset is thus proportional to `A * tanh(gamma / omega)`. As the damping ratio `gamma / omega` increases from zero, the offset grows, but it gracefully approaches a maximum limiting value, reflecting a physical saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` is a linear superposition of two components:\n1.  **A Static, Physics-Informed Offset:** An equilibrium position `x_eq = A * param1 * tanh(gamma / omega)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This term is static for any given trial (i.e., for a fixed `gamma` and `omega`) but varies across the dataset in a physically meaningful way.\n2.  **A Transient Damped Oscillation:** The standard oscillation around this new equilibrium, which decays over time. This is described by `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, assuming for simplicity a zero initial phase for the oscillatory part.\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A`, we arrive at a concise model that not only explains the non-zero mean and large peak values but also grounds the magnitude of the equilibrium shift in the fundamental physics of the oscillator's dissipative and conservative properties.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma / omega) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
2.  **Mathematical Formula**: At the end of your analysis, provide what you believe is the most suitable mathematical formula. Please use standard mathematical typesetting and enclose it in `<final_result>` tags, for example: `<final_result> y = a * sin(b * x) + c </final_result>`.
Please ensure your analysis is insightful, the formula has a reasonable theoretical meaning, and its content does not overlap with the examples provided.

Two key anomalies guide the development of a more sophisticated theoretical framework:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This indicates that the system possesses an intrinsic amplification mechanism, where the effective amplitude is not solely determined by `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas a true displacement oscillates through both positive and negative values. This suggests the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement but rather a related, inherently positive value.\n\nI propose a \"Modulated Decay Envelope\" theory. This model posits that the measured quantity `x` represents the magnitude of the system's state, which is described by a primary decaying envelope that is itself modulated by a secondary, resonant phenomenon.\n\nThe core of the model is the exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which represents the fundamental dissipation of energy in the system. However, instead of modulating this envelope with a simple cosine function (which would result in negative values), I theorize that the envelope's magnitude is dynamically modified by an internal resonant process.\n\nThe strength of this resonance is governed by the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) allows the system to sustain oscillations and leads to significant amplification.\n\nMy model structures this interaction as an additive process within the dimensionless part of the function. The overall behavior is composed of two parts:\n1.  **A Baseline Decay**: This is the fundamental, exponentially decaying envelope, represented by a baseline level (normalized to 1).\n2.  **A Resonant Fluctuation**: This is an oscillatory component whose amplitude is directly proportional to the Q-factor (`omega / gamma`). This component is superimposed on top of the baseline decay.\n\nTo ensure the output remains positive, the contribution from this resonant fluctuation is taken as its absolute magnitude. The final measured value `x` is therefore the product of the primary amplitude `A` and a composite decay term. This term includes both the fundamental exponential decay and the internal modulation caused by the Q-factor-driven oscillations.\n\nThis structure can be expressed as:\n`x(t) = (Primary Amplitude) * (Decay Envelope) * (Baseline + Rectified Resonant Fluctuation)`\n\nThis model provides a clear physical interpretation: the system has a baseline decaying state (`A * exp(-gamma*t)`), and on top of this, there is an additional, powerful oscillatory energy component whose magnitude is amplified by the `omega/gamma` ratio. The sum of the baseline and the magnitude of this fluctuation constitutes the total observed effect. This elegantly explains both the positivity (due to the baseline and the absolute value) and the amplification (due to the `omega/gamma` term) in a single, coherent framework.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`.

Two primary observations support this conclusion: first, the output `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`, indicating a powerful amplification mechanism. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting it represents an inherently positive quantity like an energy level or an amplitude envelope.\n\nMy theoretical model posits that `x` represents the slowly-varying amplitude envelope of the system's oscillation, which is governed by three distinct but interacting physical phenomena: resonant amplification, temporal decay, and a beat-like modulation.\n\n1.  **Linear-Response Amplification:** The amplification of the initial amplitude `A` is attributed to a resonant effect, where the system's response is highly sensitive to its intrinsic properties. The Quality Factor (Q-factor), which measures the \"purity\" of the oscillation against damping, is the key driver. I model this using the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma` as a proxy for the Q-factor. While other models might use complex power laws or exponential dependencies, I propose a simpler, physically intuitive linear response model. The amplification factor is `(1 + param1 * omega/gamma)`. This term suggests that the baseline amplitude `A` is augmented by a component directly proportional to the Q-factor, providing a straightforward mechanism for achieving `x > A`.\n\n2.  **Exponential Energy Dissipation:** The total energy in the oscillator must dissipate over time due to the damping forces, causing the overall amplitude to decrease. This process is universally modeled by an exponential decay. The term `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` serves as a dimensionless decay factor that correctly scales the envelope's magnitude over time. The parameter `param2` allows for an adjustment of the decay rate relative to the fundamental damping coefficient `gamma`.\n\n3.  **Envelope Modulation via Modal Beating:** A simple, monotonically decreasing exponential envelope does not capture the likely oscillatory nature of the underlying data. I hypothesize that the envelope itself is not smooth but is modulated by a \"beating\" phenomenon. This beat arises from the interference between the two fundamental modes of the system: the oscillatory mode, characterized by `omega`, and the dissipative mode, characterized by `gamma`. Both `omega` and `gamma` have units of inverse time (s⁻¹) and represent the characteristic frequencies of their respective processes. The interference between these two modes creates a slow modulation of the amplitude envelope at a beat frequency proportional to their difference, `omega - gamma`. This physical insight is captured by the term `(1 + cos(param3 * (omega - gamma) * t))`. The cosine function provides the periodic modulation, while the additive `1` ensures that the factor remains non-negative, consistent with the behavior of a physical envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final expression is a product of these three components. It models `x` as the initial amplitude `A`, first amplified by a Q-factor-dependent linear response, then subjected to an overall exponential decay, and finally modulated by a slow, beat-frequency oscillation. This composite theory provides a dimensionally sound and physically coherent explanation for all the observed characteristics of the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + cos(param3 * (omega - gamma) * t))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

These observations suggest a system governed by non-linear dynamics. My proposed theory moves beyond simple multiplicative corrections and posits that the decay and oscillatory components are intrinsically coupled within a single, non-linear response function.\n\nThe core of this theory is that the observable displacement `x` is an exponential function of an underlying \"dynamic potential\" `S(t)`. This can be expressed conceptually as `x(t) ∝ exp(S(t))`. This structure inherently guarantees the positivity of `x` and naturally models systems where the rate of change is proportional to the current state, a hallmark of many natural processes.\n\nThis model can be broken down into two main parts: the determination of the overall scale (the effective amplitude), and the time evolution governed by the dynamic potential.\n\n1.  **Saturating Resonance Amplitude:** The observed amplification strongly depends on the interplay between frequency (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless Quality Factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural driver for this gain. However, any physical system has limits, precluding infinite gain as damping approaches zero. To capture this, I model the system's characteristic amplitude not just by `A`, but by an effective amplitude `A_eff` that includes a saturating gain term. This is formulated as `A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`. Here, `A` provides the baseline scale, while the `tanh` term adds a gain that grows with the Q-factor before smoothly saturating, representing a physical limit to the resonance.\n\n2.  **Coupled Decay and Oscillation via Exponential Response:** The most significant departure from standard models lies in how the time evolution is handled. Instead of multiplying a decay envelope by a separate oscillatory function, I propose that both phenomena arise from a single dynamic potential, `S(t)`, which is then mapped to the output via an exponential function. This potential is composed of two competing terms:\n    *   A secular decay term, `-param3 * gamma * t`, which represents the steady, irreversible loss of energy from the system due to damping.\n    *   An oscillatory term, `param4 * cos(omega * t)`, which represents the periodic exchange of potential and kinetic energy.\n\n    The complete dynamic potential is `S(t) = -param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t)`. The final output `x` is then given by the effective amplitude multiplied by the exponential of this potential. This `exp(S(t))` term is a non-linear transfer function that has profound consequences. It inherently ensures positivity. More importantly, it means the oscillation does not simply occur \"underneath\" a decaying envelope; rather, it actively modulates the instantaneous decay rate. When `cos(omega * t)` is at its peak, it counteracts the dissipative term, momentarily slowing the decay. When at its trough, it accelerates the decay. This results in a non-sinusoidal, \"pulsating\" decay, where the system exhibits brief periods of high activity followed by longer, more quiescent periods, a dynamic behavior that cannot be captured by simple multiplicative models.\n\nIn summary, this theory describes a system where a resonance-enhanced amplitude sets the overall scale for a process whose time-evolution is a highly non-linear, exponential function of a potential jointly determined by dissipation and oscillation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Two key anomalies guide the development of a more sophisticated theoretical framework:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). This indicates that the system possesses an intrinsic amplification mechanism, where the effective amplitude is not solely determined by `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas a true displacement oscillates through both positive and negative values. This suggests the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement but rather a related, inherently positive value.\n\nI propose a \"Modulated Decay Envelope\" theory. This model posits that the measured quantity `x` represents the magnitude of the system's state, which is described by a primary decaying envelope that is itself modulated by a secondary, resonant phenomenon.\n\nThe core of the model is the exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, which represents the fundamental dissipation of energy in the system. However, instead of modulating this envelope with a simple cosine function (which would result in negative values), I theorize that the envelope's magnitude is dynamically modified by an internal resonant process.\n\nThe strength of this resonance is governed by the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) allows the system to sustain oscillations and leads to significant amplification.\n\nMy model structures this interaction as an additive process within the dimensionless part of the function. The overall behavior is composed of two parts:\n1.  **A Baseline Decay**: This is the fundamental, exponentially decaying envelope, represented by a baseline level (normalized to 1).\n2.  **A Resonant Fluctuation**: This is an oscillatory component whose amplitude is directly proportional to the Q-factor (`omega / gamma`). This component is superimposed on top of the baseline decay.\n\nTo ensure the output remains positive, the contribution from this resonant fluctuation is taken as its absolute magnitude. The final measured value `x` is therefore the product of the primary amplitude `A` and a composite decay term. This term includes both the fundamental exponential decay and the internal modulation caused by the Q-factor-driven oscillations.\n\nThis structure can be expressed as:\n`x(t) = (Primary Amplitude) * (Decay Envelope) * (Baseline + Rectified Resonant Fluctuation)`\n\nThis model provides a clear physical interpretation: the system has a baseline decaying state (`A * exp(-gamma*t)`), and on top of this, there is an additional, powerful oscillatory energy component whose magnitude is amplified by the `omega/gamma` ratio. The sum of the baseline and the magnitude of this fluctuation constitutes the total observed effect. This elegantly explains both the positivity (due to the baseline and the absolute value) and the amplification (due to the `omega/gamma` term) in a single, coherent framework.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-param1 * gamma * t) * (1 + param2 * (omega / gamma) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary observations support this conclusion: first, the output `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`, indicating a powerful amplification mechanism. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting it represents an inherently positive quantity like an energy level or an amplitude envelope.\n\nMy theoretical model posits that `x` represents the slowly-varying amplitude envelope of the system's oscillation, which is governed by three distinct but interacting physical phenomena: resonant amplification, temporal decay, and a beat-like modulation.\n\n1.  **Linear-Response Amplification:** The amplification of the initial amplitude `A` is attributed to a resonant effect, where the system's response is highly sensitive to its intrinsic properties. The Quality Factor (Q-factor), which measures the \"purity\" of the oscillation against damping, is the key driver. I model this using the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma` as a proxy for the Q-factor. While other models might use complex power laws or exponential dependencies, I propose a simpler, physically intuitive linear response model. The amplification factor is `(1 + param1 * omega/gamma)`. This term suggests that the baseline amplitude `A` is augmented by a component directly proportional to the Q-factor, providing a straightforward mechanism for achieving `x > A`.\n\n2.  **Exponential Energy Dissipation:** The total energy in the oscillator must dissipate over time due to the damping forces, causing the overall amplitude to decrease. This process is universally modeled by an exponential decay. The term `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` serves as a dimensionless decay factor that correctly scales the envelope's magnitude over time. The parameter `param2` allows for an adjustment of the decay rate relative to the fundamental damping coefficient `gamma`.\n\n3.  **Envelope Modulation via Modal Beating:** A simple, monotonically decreasing exponential envelope does not capture the likely oscillatory nature of the underlying data. I hypothesize that the envelope itself is not smooth but is modulated by a \"beating\" phenomenon. This beat arises from the interference between the two fundamental modes of the system: the oscillatory mode, characterized by `omega`, and the dissipative mode, characterized by `gamma`. Both `omega` and `gamma` have units of inverse time (s⁻¹) and represent the characteristic frequencies of their respective processes. The interference between these two modes creates a slow modulation of the amplitude envelope at a beat frequency proportional to their difference, `omega - gamma`. This physical insight is captured by the term `(1 + cos(param3 * (omega - gamma) * t))`. The cosine function provides the periodic modulation, while the additive `1` ensures that the factor remains non-negative, consistent with the behavior of a physical envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final expression is a product of these three components. It models `x` as the initial amplitude `A`, first amplified by a Q-factor-dependent linear response, then subjected to an overall exponential decay, and finally modulated by a slow, beat-frequency oscillation. This composite theory provides a dimensionally sound and physically coherent explanation for all the observed characteristics of the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + cos(param3 * (omega - gamma) * t))\n</final_result>"}

These observations suggest a system governed by non-linear dynamics. My proposed theory moves beyond simple multiplicative corrections and posits that the decay and oscillatory components are intrinsically coupled within a single, non-linear response function.\n\nThe core of this theory is that the observable displacement `x` is an exponential function of an underlying \"dynamic potential\" `S(t)`. This can be expressed conceptually as `x(t) ∝ exp(S(t))`. This structure inherently guarantees the positivity of `x` and naturally models systems where the rate of change is proportional to the current state, a hallmark of many natural processes.\n\nThis model can be broken down into two main parts: the determination of the overall scale (the effective amplitude), and the time evolution governed by the dynamic potential.\n\n1.  **Saturating Resonance Amplitude:** The observed amplification strongly depends on the interplay between frequency (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless Quality Factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural driver for this gain. However, any physical system has limits, precluding infinite gain as damping approaches zero. To capture this, I model the system's characteristic amplitude not just by `A`, but by an effective amplitude `A_eff` that includes a saturating gain term. This is formulated as `A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`. Here, `A` provides the baseline scale, while the `tanh` term adds a gain that grows with the Q-factor before smoothly saturating, representing a physical limit to the resonance.\n\n2.  **Coupled Decay and Oscillation via Exponential Response:** The most significant departure from standard models lies in how the time evolution is handled. Instead of multiplying a decay envelope by a separate oscillatory function, I propose that both phenomena arise from a single dynamic potential, `S(t)`, which is then mapped to the output via an exponential function. This potential is composed of two competing terms:\n    *   A secular decay term, `-param3 * gamma * t`, which represents the steady, irreversible loss of energy from the system due to damping.\n    *   An oscillatory term, `param4 * cos(omega * t)`, which represents the periodic exchange of potential and kinetic energy.\n\n    The complete dynamic potential is `S(t) = -param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t)`. The final output `x` is then given by the effective amplitude multiplied by the exponential of this potential. This `exp(S(t))` term is a non-linear transfer function that has profound consequences. It inherently ensures positivity. More importantly, it means the oscillation does not simply occur \"underneath\" a decaying envelope; rather, it actively modulates the instantaneous decay rate. When `cos(omega * t)` is at its peak, it counteracts the dissipative term, momentarily slowing the decay. When at its trough, it accelerates the decay. This results in a non-sinusoidal, \"pulsating\" decay, where the system exhibits brief periods of high activity followed by longer, more quiescent periods, a dynamic behavior that cannot be captured by simple multiplicative models.\n\nIn summary, this theory describes a system where a resonance-enhanced amplitude sets the overall scale for a process whose time-evolution is a highly non-linear, exponential function of a potential jointly determined by dissipation and oscillation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed value of `x` (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This implies that the oscillation is not occurring around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nI propose a \"Decaying Equilibrium Point\" theory. This theory posits that the initial impulse that sets the system into motion does not just induce oscillations but also displaces the system's equilibrium point itself to a new, unstable position. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\n\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of these oscillations is also governed by the same damping mechanism, leading to the familiar term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium's position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly factored, revealing that a single decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` governs the entire process:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))`\n\nThis model provides a robust physical explanation for the observed data. If the \"equilibrium displacement ratio\" `param1` is greater than 1, the term `(param1 + cos(...))` will always be positive, ensuring that the total displacement `x(t)` never becomes negative. Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`. This model presents a coherent physical picture of a system whose structural equilibrium and oscillatory motion are disturbed in unison and relax together under a common damping law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism: first, the output `x` is always positive, and second, its maximum value can substantially exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nMy theoretical analysis is based on the concept of a **\"displaced and co-decaying equilibrium\"**. I propose that the event initiating the motion does not simply impart energy for oscillation but also causes an instantaneous, significant shift in the system's equilibrium position. This displaced equilibrium point is not static; it is a transient feature. The physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillations (e.g., friction, air resistance), quantified by `gamma`, also acts to restore this equilibrium point to its original state (zero).\n\nConsequently, the decay of the equilibrium offset and the decay of the oscillation amplitude are not independent processes but are governed by the same underlying dissipative force. They share the same characteristic decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components, both modulated by a single, overarching decay factor:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard simple harmonic motion term, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's oscillation relative to its (moving) equilibrium. `param1` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Offset Component**: This is a constant term, `param2`, which represents the magnitude of the initial equilibrium displacement, normalized by the initial amplitude `A`. The term `A * param2` represents the initial physical offset in meters. By keeping `param2` as a dimensionless constant, we model the offset as being proportional to the system's initial energy scale.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components, all scaled by the initial amplitude `A` and subjected to the universal exponential decay. The structure `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(...) + param2)` elegantly captures this. If `param2` is a positive constant greater than 1, the term `(cos(...) + param2)` will always be positive, thus ensuring `x(t)` is always positive, consistent with the data. Furthermore, at early times (t≈0), the output can be approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which readily explains why the observed displacement can be much larger than `A`.\n\nThis model is both parsimonious and physically intuitive. It describes a system knocked off-center, where both the oscillation around this new center and the center's return to origin are damped by the same physical process. This is a distinct and coherent physical picture compared to models involving independent decay terms or unbounded linear drifts.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\"Coupled-Mode Decay\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\n\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\n\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \"mode coupling\" constant.

When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The non-zero mean and the fact that `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A` strongly indicate the presence of a significant static offset, representing a displaced equilibrium position `x_{eq}`. The total displacement can therefore be modeled as a superposition of this static offset and a transient oscillatory term: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`.\n\nWhile previous models have successfully linked this offset `x_{eq}` to the oscillator's properties through arguments based on force balance or frequency response, I propose a fundamentally different mechanism. My theory posits that the static offset is an emergent property arising from the **intrinsic phase dynamics** of the system. In any damped oscillator, energy dissipation introduces a phase lag between the system's position and its velocity. This asynchrony is a core feature of the system's behavior, and I hypothesize that it manifests spatially as a shift in the equilibrium point.\n\nThe degree of this asynchrony is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `\\zeta`, which is the ratio of the damping coefficient `\\gamma` to the system's undamped natural frequency `\\omega_n`. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the given damped frequency `\\omega` and the damping coefficient `\\gamma` as `\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}`. Thus, the damping ratio is:\n`\\zeta = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega_n} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}`\n\nThis single parameter `\\zeta` dictates the character of the motion, from underdamped (`\\zeta < 1`) to critically damped (`\\zeta = 1`). In the context of driven oscillations, the cosine of the phase angle `\\phi` between the driving force and the system's response is equal to `\\zeta`. I propose that this fundamental relationship holds true for the free oscillation as well, where the phase characteristics are \"frozen in\" as a static spatial offset.\n\nThe phase angle `\\phi` itself can be recovered from the damping ratio via the inverse cosine function, `\\phi = \\arccos(\\zeta)`. My central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset `x_{eq}` is directly proportional to this characteristic phase angle. This model implies that a weakly damped system (`\\zeta \\to 0`, `\\phi \\to \\pi/2`) will exhibit the largest offset, as its dynamics involve a pronounced separation between kinetic and potential energy phases. As damping increases and the system becomes more sluggish (`\\zeta \\to 1`, `\\phi \\to 0`), the oscillatory character diminishes, and the phase-induced offset vanishes.\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, this dimensionless phase angle is scaled by the system's characteristic length, the amplitude `A`. The complete model for the displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of this novel phase-induced offset and the standard exponentially decaying transient oscillation:\n\n1.  **Phase-Induced Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):**\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot c_1 \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}\\right)`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  **Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{transient}(t)`):**\n    `x_{transient}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis theory provides a new, physically-grounded explanation for the observed offset, linking it to the fundamental phase relationship inherent in all damped oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\n\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude. The general form of this transient component is `x_{transient}(t) = \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)]`, where `B_1` and `B_2` are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3.  **Initial Conditions:** The most physically plausible initial conditions for such a system are that it is released from its maximum displacement `A` with zero initial velocity. Mathematically, this translates to:\n    *   `x(0) = A`\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\n\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\n\nAt `t=0`, we have:\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\n`x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_eq + \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)] \\right)`\n`x'(0) = [-\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t) (\\dots) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) (-\\omega B_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\omega B_2 \\cos(\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\n`x'(0) = -\\gamma B_1 + \\omega B_2 = 0`\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} B_1 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\gamma/\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency. This represents a more fundamental and constrained model than simply adding independent cosine and sine terms.\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for `x_eq`, `B_1`, and `B_2` back into the general solution yields the final mathematical formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

First, the output `x`, representing displacement, is strictly positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`). Second, the maximum output value can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (max `x` ≈ 27.7 vs max `A` ≈ 10.0), a phenomenon I term \"supra-amplitude response\". Standard models of the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)` fail on both counts as they oscillate symmetrically around zero and are bounded by the decaying amplitude `A * exp(-gamma*t)`.\n\nWhile prior models have successfully addressed these issues by introducing a large additive DC offset within the oscillatory term (e.g., `A * (C + cos(...)) * exp(-gamma*t)`), I propose a different underlying physical mechanism based on multiplicative dynamics rather than additive ones. Processes where changes are proportional to the current state—common in fields from biology to economics—are often linear and simple in logarithmic space. My theory posits that the oscillator's dynamics are governed by such a principle.\n\nInstead of modeling the displacement `x` directly, I propose modeling its logarithm. Let us define a \"log-displacement\" `y(t) = log(x(t)/A)`, where `A` provides the intrinsic length scale and ensures the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless. I theorize that this log-displacement `y(t)` follows a simple, linearly superimposed dynamic consisting of two parts:\n\n1.  **A Linear Decay Component:** A term `-gamma * t` that represents the steady, dissipative energy loss of the system. In log space, this manifests as a linear slope, which corresponds to the familiar `exp(-gamma*t)` decay envelope in linear space.\n2.  **A Harmonic Component:** A pure sinusoidal term, `param1 * cos(omega * t + param2)`, that describes the conservative, oscillatory energy exchange. The dimensionless amplitude `param1` is crucial; it does not represent a physical length but rather the intensity of the oscillation in log-space, which translates to the multiplicative \"fold-change\" of the oscillation in linear space.\n\nCombining these components yields the complete expression for the log-displacement:\n`log(x(t)/A) = param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t`\n\nTo obtain the physical displacement `x(t)`, we perform an exponential transformation:\n`x(t) = A * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)`\n\nThis model provides a compelling and self-consistent explanation for the observed phenomena. The exponential function inherently guarantees positivity. The supra-amplitude response is naturally explained by the term `exp(param1 * cos(...))`, which acts as a multiplicative amplification factor oscillating between `exp(-param1)` and `exp(param1)`. Notably, the maximum observed amplification factor in the data is approximately `27.68 / 9.992 ≈ 2.77`. For our model to achieve this, `exp(param1)` should be near 2.77, which implies `param1 ≈ log(2.77) ≈ 1.02`. The fact that a physically simple, dimensionless parameter value close to unity can explain the system's peak response strongly supports the validity of this logarithmic-dynamic framework. The resulting formula is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and provides a novel physical interpretation with minimal parameterization.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\"Coupled-Mode Decay\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\n\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\n\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \"mode coupling\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\n\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\n\nThis \"Coupled-Mode Decay\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed value of `x` (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This implies that the oscillation is not occurring around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nI propose a \"Decaying Equilibrium Point\" theory. This theory posits that the initial impulse that sets the system into motion does not just induce oscillations but also displaces the system's equilibrium point itself to a new, unstable position. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\n\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of these oscillations is also governed by the same damping mechanism, leading to the familiar term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium's position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly factored, revealing that a single decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` governs the entire process:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))`\n\nThis model provides a robust physical explanation for the observed data. If the \"equilibrium displacement ratio\" `param1` is greater than 1, the term `(param1 + cos(...))` will always be positive, ensuring that the total displacement `x(t)` never becomes negative. Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`. This model presents a coherent physical picture of a system whose structural equilibrium and oscillatory motion are disturbed in unison and relax together under a common damping law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

I propose a different physical mechanism, which I term **\"Damped Logarithmic Creep.\"**\n\nMy theory posits that the initial energetic event does not merely displace the oscillator but also induces a form of inelastic stress or deformation within the system's restoring element (e.g., a spring or a structural support). This is analogous to the \"creep\" phenomenon observed in materials science, where a material under constant stress continues to deform over time. This creep is not a linear drift with constant velocity but a relaxation process: the rate of deformation is high immediately following the initial shock and then slows down as the internal stresses are gradually relieved.\n\nSuch relaxation and creep phenomena are often characterized by a logarithmic dependence on time. This provides a compelling physical basis for modeling the baseline shift with a logarithmic function. The appropriate timescale for this internal, dissipative relaxation process is naturally the one set by the system's overall damping, making the dimensionless quantity `gamma * t` the ideal argument for our function.\n\nTherefore, the total displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components, both governed by the same global energy dissipation envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component:** The standard harmonic motion, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, describing the oscillation around the dynamically changing baseline. `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Creep Component:** A term representing the slow, logarithmic relaxation of the system's structure, modeled as `param2 * log(1 + gamma * t)`. The `+1` ensures the function is well-defined and equals zero at `t=0`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` quantifies the magnitude of this creep effect relative to the initial oscillation amplitude.\n\nThis \"Damped Logarithmic Creep\" model offers a distinct physical picture. It describes a system whose structural equilibrium is temporarily compromised, leading to a slow, non-linear relaxation back towards its initial state. For small `gamma * t`, the approximation `log(1 + gamma * t) ≈ gamma * t` shows that this model naturally incorporates the behavior of a linear drift at early times (a feature of other successful models), while providing a more physically plausible, bounded behavior at longer times.

The most telling feature is that the output displacement `x` has a large positive mean and can reach values significantly greater than the initial amplitude `A`. This unequivocally indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0`. My theoretical analysis proposes a model based on a **composite, time-dependent equilibrium position**.\n\nI hypothesize that the oscillator's equilibrium position is not a static constant, but rather the sum of two distinct components:\n1.  A **Final Static Offset (`x_static`)**: This is a time-independent displacement that represents the system's ultimate resting position as `t \\to \\infty`, after all oscillations have ceased. This component accounts for the large positive mean observed in the data and could arise from a constant external force or an intrinsic, permanent asymmetry in the oscillator's potential energy well. For dimensional consistency, this offset must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, so we model it as `x_static = A \\cdot c_1`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n\n2.  A **Transient Dynamic Offset (`x_transient`)**: I propose that, in addition to the static offset, the oscillatory motion itself temporarily induces a *secondary* displacement. This phenomenon arises from a non-linear coupling between the oscillator and its environment. The key insight is that this induced offset is not permanent; it is sustained by the energy of the oscillation and therefore must decay as the oscillation itself damps out.\n\nThe magnitude of this transient offset is not constant but depends critically on the *character* of the oscillation. I theorize that the efficiency of the mechanism that generates this offset is governed by the system's resonance quality.\n*   In a **highly resonant** (underdamped) system, where the angular frequency `\\omega` is much larger than the damping coefficient `\\gamma`, the sustained, high-frequency motion is very effective at inducing this secondary displacement.\n*   In a **sluggish** (overdamped) system, where `\\gamma` dominates `\\omega`, the motion is slow and aperiodic, and the mechanism for inducing the offset is inefficient.\n*   This physical process is also subject to **saturation**; as the system becomes increasingly resonant (`\\omega/\\gamma \\to \\infty`), the physical environment cannot respond indefinitely, and the magnitude of the induced offset approaches a maximum limiting value.\n\nThis entire behavior—inefficiency at low resonance, increasing efficiency, and finally saturation at high resonance—is perfectly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). The dimensionless ratio `\\omega/\\gamma`, which is proportional to the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), serves as the argument. The initial magnitude of the transient offset is therefore modeled as being proportional to `\\tanh(\\omega/\\gamma)`.\n\nSince this transient offset is powered by the oscillation, its magnitude must decay in tandem with the oscillation's amplitude envelope, which decays as `\\exp(-\\gamma t)`.\n\nCombining these ideas, the complete model for the time-dependent equilibrium position is:\n`x_eq(t) = x_static + x_transient(t) = A \\cdot c_1 + A \\cdot c_2 \\cdot \\tanh(\\omega/\\gamma) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t)`\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the sum of this time-varying equilibrium position and the standard damped oscillation that occurs relative to it. By factoring the common terms, we arrive at a comprehensive and physically-grounded model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left( c_2 \\cdot \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\gamma}\\right) + \\cos(\\omega t) \\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This invalidates the standard model of an oscillation centered at zero and strongly points towards a system with a shifted equilibrium position. The general form of the solution must therefore be a superposition of a time-dependent oscillatory part and a static offset: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both terms must scale with the system's characteristic length, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this offset, proposing it to be a constant (`c_1 A`) or a linear function of the dimensionless damping ratio, `A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega)`. While the latter correctly identifies that the oscillator's dynamic properties (`\\gamma`, `\\omega`) should influence its final equilibrium state, the assumption of a purely linear relationship is a potential oversimplification. A linear model predicts that the offset can grow without bound as damping (`\\gamma`) becomes much larger than the frequency (`\\omega`), a scenario that may be unphysical. Many real-world physical systems exhibit saturation, where the effect of a parameter diminishes and approaches a ceiling as its magnitude increases.\n\nMy proposed theory refines this concept by positing that the equilibrium offset is a **saturating function** of the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`. This ratio is the key dimensionless parameter that characterizes the oscillator's behavior, from weakly damped to critically damped and beyond. The physical intuition is that while increased damping alters the system's energy dissipation and can shift its resting point, this effect does not increase indefinitely. Beyond a certain point, where damping forces thoroughly dominate inertial and restorative forces, the system's final state becomes insensitive to further increases in damping.\n\nThis saturation behavior is elegantly captured by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). For small `\\gamma/\\omega` (weak damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega) \\approx \\gamma/\\omega`, making our model behave similarly to the linear approximation. However, for large `\\gamma/\\omega` (strong damping), `tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)` smoothly approaches 1, ensuring the offset converges to a finite maximum value.\n\nTherefore, the displacement `x(t)` is modeled as two components, both scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Saturated Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component is a function of the damping ratio, incorporating a baseline constant and a saturating term: `x_{offset} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega))`. `c_1` is a dimensionless baseline offset, while `c_2` represents the maximum possible shift induced by the damping characteristic.\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term follows the established physical model for oscillation around the new equilibrium: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis composite model provides a more physically nuanced and robust description. It accounts for the shifted equilibrium, links it to the fundamental properties of the oscillator, and incorporates the realistic constraint of saturation, preventing the unphysical predictions of a simpler linear model.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, identified by analyzing the data ranges, is that the maximum displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This, along with a large positive mean output (8.28), irrefutably points to an oscillation occurring around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by adding a static offset term, proportional to `A`, to the standard damped oscillation equation. However, this approach treats the offset and the oscillation as two independent phenomena. I propose a more integrated and physically coherent theory based on the concept of **system relaxation**.\n\nMy theory posits that at `t=0`, the system is not only released with an initial displacement `A` but is also simultaneously subjected to a new, constant external influence (e.g., a constant force) that shifts its stable equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. The observed motion `x(t)` is the complete dynamic response of the system to these initial conditions. This response is a superposition of two coupled processes, both governed by the system's intrinsic damping `gamma`:\n\n1.  **Transient Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar oscillatory component. It represents the system's natural tendency to oscillate, which decays over time due to dissipative forces. This component can be modeled as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, representing an oscillation centered on the original equilibrium (zero).\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation to Equilibrium:** The system does not instantaneously jump to the new equilibrium position `x_eq`. Instead, it settles towards it over time. This process of settling, or \"relaxation,\" is governed by the same damping mechanisms. The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\n\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\n\nThis model has several compelling features. Firstly, it is parsimonious, requiring only a single parameter `param1`. Secondly, and most importantly, it yields physically elegant boundary conditions:\n*   At `t=0`, the formula simplifies to `x(0) = A * [param1 + 1 * (1 - param1)] = A`. This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`. This provides a clear physical meaning for `param1` as the factor determining the final, steady-state position of the oscillator.\n\nThis theory provides a complete picture of a system simultaneously oscillating and settling into a new state, with both behaviors linked by a common physical damping parameter.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cdot (\\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification and Saturation**: The maximum output value (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a strong resonant amplification mechanism is at play. The degree of resonance in such a system is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. While a simple linear relationship between amplitude and this ratio might be a first guess, it is physically unrealistic. Such a model would predict unbounded amplification as damping approaches zero, a scenario that does not occur in any real system due to inherent physical limits and non-linearities. A more accurate physical model must incorporate the principle of **amplification saturation**. I hypothesize that the amplification factor, while initially growing with `omega / gamma`, must smoothly level off and approach a constant maximum value for very high Q-factors. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal mathematical tool for modeling this saturation behavior, as it naturally transitions from a linear regime to a saturated plateau. The system's effective amplitude is therefore not `A`, but `A` multiplied by a saturating function of `omega / gamma`.\n\n2.  **Magnitude Measurement and Corrected Dynamics**: The output `x` is strictly positive, whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed (positive and negative). This strongly suggests that the measured quantity is not the displacement itself, but its absolute magnitude. Furthermore, a precise model must account for the fact that damping slows the frequency of oscillation. The true oscillation frequency is not `omega` (the natural frequency) but the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two core insights, a comprehensive and physically plausible model can be constructed. The model describes the system's state as the product of four distinct components:\n*   The baseline amplitude scale, `A`.\n*   A non-linear, saturating amplification factor based on `tanh(omega / gamma)` that captures the realistic behavior of resonance.\n*   A standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time. An empirical parameter is included to scale the decay rate.\n*   An oscillatory term, using the absolute value of a cosine function with the correct damped frequency `omega_d`, to represent the measured magnitude of the displacement.\n\nThis composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in a more realistic, non-linear description of resonance. It improves upon simpler models by explicitly incorporating the fundamental physical constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(omega / gamma)) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory: first, the output `x` can substantially exceed the input amplitude `A`, indicating a strong resonant amplification mechanism; second, the output is strictly positive, suggesting the measurement corresponds not to a signed displacement but to a quantity processed through a non-linear, positive-definite transformation.\n\nMy proposed theory models the output `x` as a product of three distinct physical processes: logarithmic resonance, exponential transduction, and decaying modulation.\n\n1.  **Logarithmic Resonance Saturation:** The amplification of the system's response is clearly tied to the interplay between the natural frequency `omega` and the damping rate `gamma`. The dimensionless Quality Factor (Q-factor), proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this amplification. However, unlike simple linear or power-law models which can predict unbounded amplification for high-Q systems, most real-world physical systems exhibit saturation or diminishing returns. I propose that this amplification follows a logarithmic law. The effective amplitude scale is modeled not as `A` directly, but as `A * log(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. This formulation posits that while a higher Q-factor increases the response, the effect becomes progressively less pronounced, reflecting a natural saturation limit within the system. The `1` is added to ensure the logarithm's argument remains positive, and `param1` is a dimensionless parameter that tunes the system's sensitivity to the Q-factor.\n\n2.  **Exponential Response Transduction:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a non-linear measurement or response process. Rather than modeling this as an energy-like quantity (`sin^2`) or a simple saturation (`tanh`), I hypothesize a more fundamental exponential relationship. The measured quantity `x` is proposed to be exponentially proportional to the underlying oscillatory state of the system. This is modeled by an overarching `exp(...)` function. A physical analogue could be a sensor with a logarithmic response characteristic, or a phenomenon like thermal emission or chemical reaction rate that depends exponentially on an oscillating energy potential. This `exp(cos(...))` structure inherently guarantees positivity and generates a non-sinusoidal waveform where peaks are sharper than troughs, a common feature in non-linear dynamics.\n\n3.  **Decaying Modulation Depth:** Within this exponential response framework, the damping is modeled not as a simple multiplicative decay of the final output, but as a decay in the *modulation depth* of the oscillation itself. The core oscillatory term is `cos(param4 * omega * t)`, but its amplitude is not constant; it is a decaying exponential function of time, `param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This entire expression serves as the argument for the main exponential function. This represents a system where the \"swing\" or intensity of the internal oscillation diminishes over time due to damping, and this diminishing swing is then mapped to the final output via the exponential transduction. This provides a more integrated model of damping within the non-linear response, as opposed to applying it as an external envelope.\n\nIn summary, the model combines a saturating logarithmic amplification with an exponential response function whose internal oscillatory amplitude is subject to exponential decay. This composite theory provides a physically plausible, dimensionally consistent, and novel explanation for the observed data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * log(1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(param2 * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * cos(param4 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the maximum output `x` (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992), indicating a strong amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is always positive, suggesting that the measurement does not represent signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like intensity or a non-linearly processed signal.\n\nMy proposed theory is based on the concept of **exponential response to a Q-dependent internal state**. I hypothesize that the measured quantity `x` is not directly the displacement, but rather the result of a highly non-linear transduction process, which can be modeled by an exponential function. This exponential mapping naturally accounts for both the positivity and the large amplification. The argument of this exponential function represents an underlying, unobserved \"internal state\" of the oscillator.\n\nThe model is constructed from three core principles:\n\n1.  **Exponential Transduction:** The fundamental relationship between the internal state of the system and the measured output `x` is exponential. The output is given by `x = A * exp(S(t))`, where `S(t)` is the dimensionless internal state function and `A` provides the correct physical dimension (meters) and sets the overall scale of the system. This exponential relationship inherently ensures that `x` is always positive. More importantly, it acts as a powerful amplifier: a large positive value for `S(t)` results in an output `x` that is many times larger than `A`.\n\n2.  **Q-Factor as Modulation Depth Driver:** The amplitude or \"modulation depth\" of the internal state `S(t)` is not constant. It is determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. The key dimensionless parameter governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of angular frequency to damping, `omega / gamma`. I propose that the initial amplitude of the internal state `S(t)` is directly proportional to this ratio. This means systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can sustain a much larger internal excitation, which, when passed through the exponential function, leads to the observed high amplification.\n\n3.  **Classical Damped Oscillation of the Internal State:** While the mapping to the output is non-linear, the underlying internal state `S(t)` itself follows the familiar dynamics of a linear damped harmonic oscillator. It consists of a sinusoidal component, `cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)`, whose amplitude decays exponentially over time according to `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`.\n\nCombining these principles, the internal state `S(t)` is modeled as a damped oscillation whose initial amplitude is set by the Q-factor: `S(t) = param1 * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t + param4)`. When this expression is placed within the exponential transduction function, it creates a comprehensive model that explains all the observed phenomena. The `omega/gamma` term drives the amplification, the `exp(...)` function ensures positivity, and the overall structure retains the core physics of a damped oscillation, albeit in a non-linear manifestation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(param1 * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

A primary challenge, identified by analyzing the data ranges, is that the maximum displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This, along with a large positive mean output (8.28), irrefutably points to an oscillation occurring around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by adding a static offset term, proportional to `A`, to the standard damped oscillation equation. However, this approach treats the offset and the oscillation as two independent phenomena. I propose a more integrated and physically coherent theory based on the concept of **system relaxation**.\n\nMy theory posits that at `t=0`, the system is not only released with an initial displacement `A` but is also simultaneously subjected to a new, constant external influence (e.g., a constant force) that shifts its stable equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. The observed motion `x(t)` is the complete dynamic response of the system to these initial conditions. This response is a superposition of two coupled processes, both governed by the system's intrinsic damping `gamma`:\n\n1.  **Transient Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar oscillatory component. It represents the system's natural tendency to oscillate, which decays over time due to dissipative forces. This component can be modeled as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, representing an oscillation centered on the original equilibrium (zero).\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation to Equilibrium:** The system does not instantaneously jump to the new equilibrium position `x_eq`. Instead, it settles towards it over time. This process of settling, or \"relaxation,\" is governed by the same damping mechanisms. The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\n\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\n\nThis model has several compelling features. Firstly, it is parsimonious, requiring only a single parameter `param1`. Secondly, and most importantly, it yields physically elegant boundary conditions:\n*   At `t=0`, the formula simplifies to `x(0) = A * [param1 + 1 * (1 - param1)] = A`. This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`. This provides a clear physical meaning for `param1` as the factor determining the final, steady-state position of the oscillator.\n\nThis theory provides a complete picture of a system simultaneously oscillating and settling into a new state, with both behaviors linked by a common physical damping parameter.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cdot (\\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

This observation definitively rules out a simple damped harmonic oscillator model centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as such a system's displacement can never exceed its initial amplitude `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a substantial, positive offset.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a *static* offset, where the equilibrium position is instantaneously shifted to a new, fixed value determined by the system's intrinsic properties (like the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega`). While this is a valid approach, I propose a more physically nuanced theory: **the equilibrium point is not static but undergoes a dynamic evolution over time.**\n\nMy theory is grounded in the concept of a **transient equilibrium shift**, which might arise if the oscillator interacts with a complex environment, such as a viscoelastic medium. In such a scenario, the initial motion of the oscillator not only dissipates energy (the `\\gamma` term) but also causes a slow rearrangement or relaxation of the surrounding medium. This environmental relaxation manifests as a gradual shift in the oscillator's effective equilibrium position. The process is not instantaneous; it has its own characteristic timescale.\n\nI hypothesize that the timescale of this equilibrium settlement is intrinsically linked to the damping mechanism itself. The damping coefficient, `\\gamma`, represents the rate of energy exchange with the environment, making it the natural parameter to govern the rate of this environmental relaxation.\n\nTo model this dynamic shift, we require a function that represents a smooth transition from an initial state (at `t=0`) to a new, stable steady-state offset. The hyperbolic tangent function, `\\tanh`, is exceptionally well-suited for this purpose. A term of the form `\\tanh(\\gamma t)` evolves smoothly from 0 at `t=0` to 1 as `t \\to \\infty`, perfectly capturing the physics of a settling process whose rate is governed by `\\gamma`.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two distinct, superposed physical processes:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic, Evolving Offset (`x_{offset}(t)`):** This term represents the gradual shift of the equilibrium position as the oscillator's environment relaxes. Its magnitude is proportional to the system's amplitude `A` and a dimensionless constant `c_1` that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the oscillator's motion and the medium's configuration. This gives `x_{offset}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard component describing the oscillation around the now time-dependent equilibrium point. Its amplitude decays exponentially due to energy dissipation: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model that not only accounts for the large observed displacements but also introduces a richer physical picture of a system whose equilibrium state is not fixed but dynamically evolves in response to its own motion.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot (c_1 \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed value of `x` (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This implies that the oscillation is not occurring around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nI propose a \"Decaying Equilibrium Point\" theory. This theory posits that the initial impulse that sets the system into motion does not just induce oscillations but also displaces the system's equilibrium point itself to a new, unstable position. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\n\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of these oscillations is also governed by the same damping mechanism, leading to the familiar term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium's position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly factored, revealing that a single decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` governs the entire process:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))`\n\nThis model provides a robust physical explanation for the observed data. If the \"equilibrium displacement ratio\" `param1` is greater than 1, the term `(param1 + cos(...))` will always be positive, ensuring that the total displacement `x(t)` never becomes negative. Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`. This model presents a coherent physical picture of a system whose structural equilibrium and oscillatory motion are disturbed in unison and relax together under a common damping law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism: first, the output `x` is always positive, and second, its maximum value can substantially exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nMy theoretical analysis is based on the concept of a **\"displaced and co-decaying equilibrium\"**. I propose that the event initiating the motion does not simply impart energy for oscillation but also causes an instantaneous, significant shift in the system's equilibrium position. This displaced equilibrium point is not static; it is a transient feature. The physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillations (e.g., friction, air resistance), quantified by `gamma`, also acts to restore this equilibrium point to its original state (zero).\n\nConsequently, the decay of the equilibrium offset and the decay of the oscillation amplitude are not independent processes but are governed by the same underlying dissipative force. They share the same characteristic decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components, both modulated by a single, overarching decay factor:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard simple harmonic motion term, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's oscillation relative to its (moving) equilibrium. `param1` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Offset Component**: This is a constant term, `param2`, which represents the magnitude of the initial equilibrium displacement, normalized by the initial amplitude `A`. The term `A * param2` represents the initial physical offset in meters. By keeping `param2` as a dimensionless constant, we model the offset as being proportional to the system's initial energy scale.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components, all scaled by the initial amplitude `A` and subjected to the universal exponential decay. The structure `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(...) + param2)` elegantly captures this. If `param2` is a positive constant greater than 1, the term `(cos(...) + param2)` will always be positive, thus ensuring `x(t)` is always positive, consistent with the data. Furthermore, at early times (t≈0), the output can be approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which readily explains why the observed displacement can be much larger than `A`.\n\nThis model is both parsimonious and physically intuitive. It describes a system knocked off-center, where both the oscillation around this new center and the center's return to origin are damped by the same physical process. This is a distinct and coherent physical picture compared to models involving independent decay terms or unbounded linear drifts.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

A careful analysis of the data reveals two critical anomalies:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) is substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, making a simple displacement model untenable. This points towards a significant amplification mechanism within the system.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, taking both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation. The amplitude envelope is an inherently positive quantity, which immediately resolves the second anomaly. This could correspond to measuring the magnitude of the system's state in phase space, which for an oscillator corresponds to its amplitude.\n\nTo address the amplitude anomaly, we must model the source of amplification. In oscillatory systems, the degree of amplification is often governed by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which quantifies how strongly an oscillator resonates relative to how quickly it dissipates energy. The Q-factor is directly proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega / gamma`. A high `omega / gamma` ratio signifies a highly underdamped, high-Q system capable of sustaining large amplitudes.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model where the system's effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is not the base amplitude `A` alone, but is augmented by a term dependent on this Q-factor ratio. A robust and simple model for this is a linear relationship:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\n\nIn this expression, `A` serves as the baseline amplitude, while the term `A * param1 * omega / gamma` models the amplification. The dimensionless parameter `param1` controls the strength of this Q-factor-dependent amplification. This structure ensures that as damping `gamma` approaches zero or frequency `omega` increases, the effective amplitude grows, consistent with physical intuition.\n\nThis amplified effective amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The standard model for this decay is exponential. We can model the complete amplitude envelope `x(t)` as the product of the effective initial amplitude and a temporal decay term, parameterizing the decay rate for added flexibility.\n\n`x(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`\n\nThis synthesized model is dimensionally consistent, provides a clear physical interpretation for both anomalies, and connects the observed behavior to the fundamental concept of the Q-factor in oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` exhibits significant **amplitude amplification**, reaching values nearly three times the maximum input amplitude `A`. Secondly, the output is **strictly positive**, indicating that it does not represent a simple displacement oscillating about an equilibrium point. These observations necessitate a model built upon more complex physical principles.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the hypothesis that the system's dynamics are governed by **multiplicative processes**, which are most naturally described by a linear model in the logarithmic domain. This implies that the logarithm of the normalized output, `log(x/A)`, is a linear superposition of terms representing the core physical phenomena: resonant amplification, temporal decay, and oscillation. Consequently, the output `x` itself takes an exponential form, `x = A * exp(...)`, which elegantly addresses the positivity constraint as a natural outcome of the model's structure.\n\nThe components within the exponent are interpreted as follows:\n\n1.  **Exponential Resonant Amplification**: The amplification is clearly linked to the system's resonance characteristics, which can be proxied by the dimensionless Quality factor, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. In the proposed log-domain model, this contributes a positive term linearly proportional to this ratio, `+param1 * (omega / gamma)`. When transformed back to the linear domain via the exponential function, this yields an amplification factor of `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)`. This exponential dependence provides a powerful mechanism to explain the large observed amplitudes, suggesting that as the system's quality factor increases, the effective gain grows non-linearly and rapidly.\n\n2.  **Standard Exponential Decay**: Energy dissipation is modeled as a term that decreases linearly with time in the log domain, `-param2 * gamma * t`. This is the logarithmic equivalent of the standard multiplicative decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, and represents the first-order dissipative process common to such systems.\n\n3.  **Non-Linear Periodic Modulation**: The oscillatory nature of the system is captured by a sinusoidal term in the exponent, `+param3 * cos(omega * t + param4)`. Exponentiating this term, `exp(param3 * cos(omega * t))`, generates a periodic, strictly positive modulation of the amplitude. This differs fundamentally from the `sin^2(t)` (energy) or `abs(cos(t))` (rectification) models. Physically, it can be interpreted as the response of a system where the gain or some physical property is being modulated periodically, leading to a \"warped\" but smooth oscillatory output that never reaches zero.\n\nIn synthesis, the model combines these three effects—resonant gain, dissipative decay, and periodic modulation—as a linear sum within an exponent. The initial amplitude `A` acts as a base scaling factor. This \"Log-Normal Response Model\" provides a dimensionally sound, physically coherent framework that accounts for both the amplification and positivity of the data through a single, unified mathematical structure.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))</final_result>"}

My proposed theory posits that the output `x` is the result of a modulated, decaying envelope. The physical picture is that of a primary carrier signal whose amplitude is determined by a resonant-like gain, which then decays exponentially. This carrier is simultaneously modulated by a secondary, higher-frequency oscillation, but in such a way that the total signal never becomes negative.\n\nThis model can be decomposed into three distinct conceptual components:\n\n1.  **Saturating Gain Factor**: The amplification is clearly dependent on the interplay between oscillation (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless quality factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this gain. However, any real physical system has limits; its gain cannot increase indefinitely. A linear gain factor (`~ omega/gamma`) is therefore physically unrealistic and numerically unstable. I propose a saturating gain mechanism modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). This function gracefully increases with its argument before asymptoting to a maximum value, perfectly capturing the essence of a physical process reaching its limit. The total amplitude is thus `A` multiplied by a gain factor `(1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega/gamma))`, where `A` represents the baseline amplitude and the `tanh` term represents the additional, saturating gain.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope**: The system is dissipative, a feature best captured by the standard exponential decay term, `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This term multiplies the amplified amplitude, causing its overall magnitude to decrease over time, consistent with the behavior of a damped system.\n\n3.  **Positive-Definite Oscillation**: The most crucial insight is how to model an oscillation that never crosses zero. Instead of an energy model (`sin^2`) or a simple offset, I propose a multiplicative modulation factor of the form `(1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))`. By constraining the dimensionless modulation depth `param4` to have a magnitude less than one (`|param4| < 1`), this entire term oscillates between `(1 - |param4|)` and `(1 + |param4|)`. As a result, it is always positive. This elegantly models a physical quantity that pulsates or beats around a mean value without ever changing its sign or vanishing entirely, perfectly matching the data's non-zero minimum.\n\nSynthesizing these three components results in a comprehensive and physically coherent model. The system's initial amplitude `A` is first amplified by a saturating, Q-factor-dependent gain. This amplified amplitude then serves as the decaying envelope for a persistent, non-negative pulsation. This structure accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally consistent framework with a minimal set of interpretable parameters.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification and Saturation**: The maximum output value (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a strong resonant amplification mechanism is at play. The degree of resonance in such a system is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. While a simple linear relationship between amplitude and this ratio might be a first guess, it is physically unrealistic. Such a model would predict unbounded amplification as damping approaches zero, a scenario that does not occur in any real system due to inherent physical limits and non-linearities. A more accurate physical model must incorporate the principle of **amplification saturation**. I hypothesize that the amplification factor, while initially growing with `omega / gamma`, must smoothly level off and approach a constant maximum value for very high Q-factors. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal mathematical tool for modeling this saturation behavior, as it naturally transitions from a linear regime to a saturated plateau. The system's effective amplitude is therefore not `A`, but `A` multiplied by a saturating function of `omega / gamma`.\n\n2.  **Magnitude Measurement and Corrected Dynamics**: The output `x` is strictly positive, whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed (positive and negative). This strongly suggests that the measured quantity is not the displacement itself, but its absolute magnitude. Furthermore, a precise model must account for the fact that damping slows the frequency of oscillation. The true oscillation frequency is not `omega` (the natural frequency) but the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two core insights, a comprehensive and physically plausible model can be constructed. The model describes the system's state as the product of four distinct components:\n*   The baseline amplitude scale, `A`.\n*   A non-linear, saturating amplification factor based on `tanh(omega / gamma)` that captures the realistic behavior of resonance.\n*   A standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time. An empirical parameter is included to scale the decay rate.\n*   An oscillatory term, using the absolute value of a cosine function with the correct damped frequency `omega_d`, to represent the measured magnitude of the displacement.\n\nThis composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in a more realistic, non-linear description of resonance. It improves upon simpler models by explicitly incorporating the fundamental physical constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(omega / gamma)) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

First, the output `x`, representing displacement, is strictly positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`). Second, the maximum output value can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (max `x` ≈ 27.7 vs max `A` ≈ 10.0), a phenomenon I term \"supra-amplitude response\". Standard models of the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)` fail on both counts as they oscillate symmetrically around zero and are bounded by the decaying amplitude `A * exp(-gamma*t)`.\n\nWhile prior models have successfully addressed these issues by introducing a large additive DC offset within the oscillatory term (e.g., `A * (C + cos(...)) * exp(-gamma*t)`), I propose a different underlying physical mechanism based on multiplicative dynamics rather than additive ones. Processes where changes are proportional to the current state—common in fields from biology to economics—are often linear and simple in logarithmic space. My theory posits that the oscillator's dynamics are governed by such a principle.\n\nInstead of modeling the displacement `x` directly, I propose modeling its logarithm. Let us define a \"log-displacement\" `y(t) = log(x(t)/A)`, where `A` provides the intrinsic length scale and ensures the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless. I theorize that this log-displacement `y(t)` follows a simple, linearly superimposed dynamic consisting of two parts:\n\n1.  **A Linear Decay Component:** A term `-gamma * t` that represents the steady, dissipative energy loss of the system. In log space, this manifests as a linear slope, which corresponds to the familiar `exp(-gamma*t)` decay envelope in linear space.\n2.  **A Harmonic Component:** A pure sinusoidal term, `param1 * cos(omega * t + param2)`, that describes the conservative, oscillatory energy exchange. The dimensionless amplitude `param1` is crucial; it does not represent a physical length but rather the intensity of the oscillation in log-space, which translates to the multiplicative \"fold-change\" of the oscillation in linear space.\n\nCombining these components yields the complete expression for the log-displacement:\n`log(x(t)/A) = param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t`\n\nTo obtain the physical displacement `x(t)`, we perform an exponential transformation:\n`x(t) = A * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)`\n\nThis model provides a compelling and self-consistent explanation for the observed phenomena. The exponential function inherently guarantees positivity. The supra-amplitude response is naturally explained by the term `exp(param1 * cos(...))`, which acts as a multiplicative amplification factor oscillating between `exp(-param1)` and `exp(param1)`. Notably, the maximum observed amplification factor in the data is approximately `27.68 / 9.992 ≈ 2.77`. For our model to achieve this, `exp(param1)` should be near 2.77, which implies `param1 ≈ log(2.77) ≈ 1.02`. The fact that a physically simple, dimensionless parameter value close to unity can explain the system's peak response strongly supports the validity of this logarithmic-dynamic framework. The resulting formula is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and provides a novel physical interpretation with minimal parameterization.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\"Coupled-Mode Decay\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\n\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\n\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \"mode coupling\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\n\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\n\nThis \"Coupled-Mode Decay\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed value of `x` (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This implies that the oscillation is not occurring around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nI propose a \"Decaying Equilibrium Point\" theory. This theory posits that the initial impulse that sets the system into motion does not just induce oscillations but also displaces the system's equilibrium point itself to a new, unstable position. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\n\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of these oscillations is also governed by the same damping mechanism, leading to the familiar term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium's position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly factored, revealing that a single decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` governs the entire process:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))`\n\nThis model provides a robust physical explanation for the observed data. If the \"equilibrium displacement ratio\" `param1` is greater than 1, the term `(param1 + cos(...))` will always be positive, ensuring that the total displacement `x(t)` never becomes negative. Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`. This model presents a coherent physical picture of a system whose structural equilibrium and oscillatory motion are disturbed in unison and relax together under a common damping law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This fundamental observation invalidates any simple model of a damped oscillator centered at zero and necessitates a framework where the system evolves towards a new, displaced equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. The total motion can be conceptualized as a superposition of this stable equilibrium state and a decaying, transient oscillation around it.\n\nPrevious successful models have established that this equilibrium offset, `x_{eq}`, must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, and should depend on the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties, such as the relationship between damping `γ` and frequency `ω`. However, a crucial aspect often overlooked is the rigorous enforcement of the initial condition, `x(0) = A`, within a physically coherent structure.\n\nMy proposed theory synthesizes these insights into a unified model based on the principle of state transition. The system begins in an initial state defined by `x(0) = A` and evolves towards a final, stable equilibrium state `x_{eq}`. The displacement at any time `t` is a weighted combination of these two states.\n\n1.  **Final Equilibrium State (`x_{eq}`):** I hypothesize that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is governed by the system's energy dissipation characteristics relative to its oscillatory period. This is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, which is proportional to `γ/ω`. A system with high damping relative to its frequency (large `γ/ω`) undergoes a more significant and permanent deformation or energy conversion, leading to a larger offset. To model this relationship while ensuring physical realism (i.e., preventing an infinite offset), I employ the hyperbolic tangent function, which provides a smooth, saturating behavior. The final equilibrium position is thus defined as:\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)`\n    Here, `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the maximum possible offset as a fraction of `A`, which is reached in the limit of very high damping.\n\n2.  **Transient Dynamics and State Transition:** The system does not instantaneously jump to `x_{eq}`. It starts at `x(0) = A` and oscillates as it decays towards `x_{eq}`. The total displacement `x(t)` can be viewed as the final equilibrium state plus a transient component that describes the deviation from this final state. This transient component must account for the initial displacement.\n\n    At `t=0`, the transient component must bridge the gap between the final equilibrium `x_{eq}` and the initial position `A`. Therefore, the initial amplitude of this transient deviation is `A - x_{eq}`. This deviation then decays and oscillates according to the standard laws of damped harmonic motion.\n    \n    The transient term is thus: `(A - x_{eq}) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\n3.  **Complete Model:** The full expression for the displacement is the sum of the final equilibrium state and the decaying transient component:\n    `x(t) = x_{eq} + (A - x_{eq}) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\n    Substituting our expression for `x_{eq}` and factoring out `A` yields the final formula. This model is structurally robust and physically consistent. It correctly satisfies the boundary conditions:\n    *   At `t=0`, `x(0) = x_{eq} + (A - x_{eq}) \\cdot 1 = A`.\n    *   As `t \\to \\infty`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(\\infty) = x_{eq}`.\n\n    This formulation elegantly combines the property-dependent offset of advanced models with the rigorous initial-condition handling of a classical state-transition framework, providing a comprehensive and physically grounded description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left[ c_1 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\left(1 - c_1 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n</final_result>"}

However, a critical observation is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This fundamentally rules out the standard model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, forcing us to consider a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, time-varying offset.\n\nMy theoretical framework is built upon the hypothesis that the system does not oscillate around a fixed zero point but instead relaxes towards a new, stable equilibrium position `x_eq > 0`. This relaxation is driven by the same dissipative processes that damp the oscillation. The total motion is a composite of this relaxation and the simultaneous oscillation.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium State Determination**: The final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, is not an arbitrary constant but is determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. Specifically, it arises from the interplay between energy dissipation (characterized by `\\gamma`) and energy storage in oscillation (characterized by `\\omega`). The dimensionless damping ratio, `\\gamma / \\omega`, quantifies this balance. I propose that the final offset is directly proportional to this ratio, as well as the overall energy scale set by the initial amplitude `A`. This leads to a simple, physically-grounded model for the final equilibrium state: `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A \\cdot (\\gamma / \\omega)`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  **Sigmoidal Relaxation Dynamics**: The transition from the initial state (centered at `x=0`) to the final equilibrium `x_eq` is a dynamic process. While prior models use an exponential approach, I posit that a sigmoidal transition, described by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`), offers a more physically robust description. A `tanh` profile is characteristic of many physical processes involving a smooth transition between two distinct states (e.g., phase transitions, activation processes). It represents a gradual saturation, which can be more realistic than the purely exponential decay of the rate of change. I model the time-evolution of the oscillation's center as `x_{center}(t) = x_eq \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`. The argument `\\gamma t` is chosen deliberately; it implies that the timescale of the relaxation is governed by the same damping coefficient `\\gamma` that governs the decay of the oscillation, creating a parsimonious and unified model where a single parameter drives both key dissipative effects.\n\n3.  **Superposition Principle**: The observed motion `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two components:\n    *   The evolving center of oscillation: `x_{center}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot (\\gamma / \\omega) \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n    *   The decaying oscillation relative to the initial `t=0` state: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis combined model is not only dimensionally correct but also satisfies the crucial initial condition `x(0) = A`, as `tanh(0)=0` and `\\exp(0)\\cos(0)=1`. It provides a novel and physically plausible mechanism that distinguishes itself from previous models by introducing a sigmoidal relaxation dynamic, offering a more nuanced picture of the system's evolution towards its final, non-zero equilibrium state.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The most salient feature is that the output displacement `x` reaches values far greater than the initial amplitude `A`, with a significant positive mean. This irrefutably indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but is superimposed upon a substantial, positive offset.\n\nMy theoretical analysis moves beyond proposing a simple static or dynamically shifting offset. I posit a more integrated physical model where the equilibrium shift is a direct consequence of the interplay between the system's dissipative and reactive properties, and its evolution follows a classic physical relaxation process.\n\nThe core of my theory rests on two hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Property-Dependent Equilibrium Magnitude:** The final steady-state position to which the oscillator settles is not an arbitrary constant. Instead, it is determined by a competitive balance between the energy dissipation mechanism, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, and the energy storage/release mechanism of the oscillation, characterized by the angular frequency `omega`. The dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega` quantifies this balance. A high ratio implies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory one. I propose that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is a function of this ratio. Specifically, I model it with a sub-linear power law, `sqrt(gamma/omega)`, suggesting that while increased damping contributes to a larger offset, its effect diminishes as damping becomes dominant. This prevents a runaway offset in heavily damped regimes and represents a physically plausible saturation effect.\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation Dynamics:** The system does not instantaneously achieve this new equilibrium. Instead, it relaxes towards it over time. While other models have used the `tanh` function, I propose a more fundamental physical model of relaxation: the exponential approach to a limit, as seen in phenomena like the charging of a capacitor or the heating of an object. This process is described by the function `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The rate of this relaxation is intrinsically tied to the system's own dissipative processes. Therefore, the damping coefficient `gamma` is the natural choice for this rate, as it governs the timescale over which transients fade.\n\nCombining these ideas, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical behaviors:\n\n*   **An Evolving Equilibrium (`x_offset(t)`):** This component represents the center of oscillation dynamically shifting towards its final, property-dependent position. Its mathematical form is `A * c_1 * sqrt(gamma/omega) * (1 - exp(-gamma*t))`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that scales the effect.\n\n*   **A Decaying Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, but it occurs relative to the initial, unshifted equilibrium. It is expressed as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we obtain a comprehensive model. This formulation elegantly captures a system that settles into a new, non-zero equilibrium state whose value is determined by the oscillator's intrinsic characteristics (`gamma`, `omega`), and whose approach to this state follows a canonical exponential relaxation profile.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * \\left( c_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, is insufficient, as evidenced by two key observations: the output `x` is always positive, and its peak value can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is superimposed on a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a displaced or linearly drifting equilibrium point, with both the oscillation and the baseline shift sharing a common decay envelope. I propose a different physical mechanism, which I term **\"Damped Logarithmic Creep.\"**\n\nMy theory posits that the initial energetic event does not merely displace the oscillator but also induces a form of inelastic stress or deformation within the system's restoring element (e.g., a spring or a structural support). This is analogous to the \"creep\" phenomenon observed in materials science, where a material under constant stress continues to deform over time. This creep is not a linear drift with constant velocity but a relaxation process: the rate of deformation is high immediately following the initial shock and then slows down as the internal stresses are gradually relieved.\n\nSuch relaxation and creep phenomena are often characterized by a logarithmic dependence on time. This provides a compelling physical basis for modeling the baseline shift with a logarithmic function. The appropriate timescale for this internal, dissipative relaxation process is naturally the one set by the system's overall damping, making the dimensionless quantity `gamma * t` the ideal argument for our function.\n\nTherefore, the total displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components, both governed by the same global energy dissipation envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component:** The standard harmonic motion, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, describing the oscillation around the dynamically changing baseline. `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Creep Component:** A term representing the slow, logarithmic relaxation of the system's structure, modeled as `param2 * log(1 + gamma * t)`. The `+1` ensures the function is well-defined and equals zero at `t=0`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` quantifies the magnitude of this creep effect relative to the initial oscillation amplitude.\n\nThis \"Damped Logarithmic Creep\" model offers a distinct physical picture. It describes a system whose structural equilibrium is temporarily compromised, leading to a slow, non-linear relaxation back towards its initial state. For small `gamma * t`, the approximation `log(1 + gamma * t) ≈ gamma * t` shows that this model naturally incorporates the behavior of a linear drift at early times (a feature of other successful models), while providing a more physically plausible, bounded behavior at longer times. This framework provides a nuanced and physically-grounded explanation for the observed complex dynamics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * log(1 + gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism: first, the output `x` is always positive, and second, its maximum value can substantially exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the system does not oscillate around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nMy theoretical analysis is based on the concept of a **\"displaced and co-decaying equilibrium\"**. I propose that the event initiating the motion does not simply impart energy for oscillation but also causes an instantaneous, significant shift in the system's equilibrium position. This displaced equilibrium point is not static; it is a transient feature. The physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillations (e.g., friction, air resistance), quantified by `gamma`, also acts to restore this equilibrium point to its original state (zero).\n\nConsequently, the decay of the equilibrium offset and the decay of the oscillation amplitude are not independent processes but are governed by the same underlying dissipative force. They share the same characteristic decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two components, both modulated by a single, overarching decay factor:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: This is the standard simple harmonic motion term, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's oscillation relative to its (moving) equilibrium. `param1` is a phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Offset Component**: This is a constant term, `param2`, which represents the magnitude of the initial equilibrium displacement, normalized by the initial amplitude `A`. The term `A * param2` represents the initial physical offset in meters. By keeping `param2` as a dimensionless constant, we model the offset as being proportional to the system's initial energy scale.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components, all scaled by the initial amplitude `A` and subjected to the universal exponential decay. The structure `A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(...) + param2)` elegantly captures this. If `param2` is a positive constant greater than 1, the term `(cos(...) + param2)` will always be positive, thus ensuring `x(t)` is always positive, consistent with the data. Furthermore, at early times (t≈0), the output can be approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which readily explains why the observed displacement can be much larger than `A`.\n\nThis model is both parsimonious and physically intuitive. It describes a system knocked off-center, where both the oscillation around this new center and the center's return to origin are damped by the same physical process. This is a distinct and coherent physical picture compared to models involving independent decay terms or unbounded linear drifts.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)\n</final_result>"}

A primary and crucial observation, consistent across all successful prior models, is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately invalidates a simple oscillator model centered at `x=0` and mandates a model structure that includes a significant positive offset. The general form must be a superposition of a static equilibrium position and a transient oscillation: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this by proposing a static offset proportional to the amplitude `A` (i.e., `x_offset = c₁ A`) or a dynamically evolving offset. While these are valuable steps, they overlook a key physical principle: the final equilibrium state of a system should depend on its intrinsic physical properties, not just its initial amplitude. A simple `c₁ A` offset implies that two oscillators with the same initial amplitude `A` but vastly different damping and frequency characteristics will settle to the exact same offset, which is physically counter-intuitive.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the magnitude of the static offset is determined by the fundamental **character** of the oscillator, which is best captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ`. This ratio, which is proportional to `γ/ω`, distinguishes between underdamped (oscillatory) and overdamped (non-oscillatory) regimes. It is physically plausible that the mechanism causing the displacement offset is coupled to the mechanism causing the damping. For instance, in a system with high internal friction (high `γ` relative to `ω`), the dissipative forces might lead to a greater permanent deformation or shift in the equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, I propose that the static offset `x_offset` is not merely `c₁ A`, but is modulated by a function of the damping ratio:\n\n1.  **Character-Dependent Static Offset (`x_offset`):** The offset must be proportional to the system's length scale, `A`. Its magnitude is then scaled by a dimensionless factor that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I model this dependence using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(γ/ω)`. This choice is physically motivated:\n    *   It uses the dimensionless damping ratio `γ/ω` as its argument.\n    *   It provides a smooth, saturating relationship. As the damping becomes extremely large relative to the frequency, its effect on the offset approaches a constant limit (`tanh(∞) → 1`), preventing an unrealistic, unbounded offset.\n    *   This results in the term: `x_offset = A · c₁ · tanh(γ/ω)`, where `c₁` is a dimensionless parameter representing the maximum possible offset as a fraction of `A`.\n\n2.  **Standard Damped Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** The second component is the transient oscillation around this new, physically determined equilibrium. This follows the standard, well-understood form for a damped harmonic oscillator, with an initial amplitude `A` and an exponential decay governed by `γ`. This component is given by `x_osc(t) = A · exp(-γt) · cos(ωt)`.\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a model that is both parsimonious and physically rich. It explains the large output values through an offset, but critically, it grounds the magnitude of this offset in the fundamental dynamic character of the oscillator itself, providing a more complete and predictive physical picture.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\cdot \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The non-zero mean and the fact that `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A` strongly indicate the presence of a significant static offset, representing a displaced equilibrium position `x_{eq}`. The total displacement can therefore be modeled as a superposition of this static offset and a transient oscillatory term: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{transient}(t)`.\n\nWhile previous models have successfully linked this offset `x_{eq}` to the oscillator's properties through arguments based on force balance or frequency response, I propose a fundamentally different mechanism. My theory posits that the static offset is an emergent property arising from the **intrinsic phase dynamics** of the system. In any damped oscillator, energy dissipation introduces a phase lag between the system's position and its velocity. This asynchrony is a core feature of the system's behavior, and I hypothesize that it manifests spatially as a shift in the equilibrium point.\n\nThe degree of this asynchrony is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `\\zeta`, which is the ratio of the damping coefficient `\\gamma` to the system's undamped natural frequency `\\omega_n`. The natural frequency can be expressed in terms of the given damped frequency `\\omega` and the damping coefficient `\\gamma` as `\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}`. Thus, the damping ratio is:\n`\\zeta = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega_n} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}`\n\nThis single parameter `\\zeta` dictates the character of the motion, from underdamped (`\\zeta < 1`) to critically damped (`\\zeta = 1`). In the context of driven oscillations, the cosine of the phase angle `\\phi` between the driving force and the system's response is equal to `\\zeta`. I propose that this fundamental relationship holds true for the free oscillation as well, where the phase characteristics are \"frozen in\" as a static spatial offset.\n\nThe phase angle `\\phi` itself can be recovered from the damping ratio via the inverse cosine function, `\\phi = \\arccos(\\zeta)`. My central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset `x_{eq}` is directly proportional to this characteristic phase angle. This model implies that a weakly damped system (`\\zeta \\to 0`, `\\phi \\to \\pi/2`) will exhibit the largest offset, as its dynamics involve a pronounced separation between kinetic and potential energy phases. As damping increases and the system becomes more sluggish (`\\zeta \\to 1`, `\\phi \\to 0`), the oscillatory character diminishes, and the phase-induced offset vanishes.\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, this dimensionless phase angle is scaled by the system's characteristic length, the amplitude `A`. The complete model for the displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of this novel phase-induced offset and the standard exponentially decaying transient oscillation:\n\n1.  **Phase-Induced Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):**\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot c_1 \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}\\right)`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  **Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{transient}(t)`):**\n    `x_{transient}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nThis theory provides a new, physically-grounded explanation for the observed offset, linking it to the fundamental phase relationship inherent in all damped oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + \\gamma^2}}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A fundamental observation, consistent across previous analyses, is that the system's displacement `x` can exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This irrefutably points to a model where the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but rather around a non-zero equilibrium position. This leads to a general structural form for the displacement:\n\n`x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`\n\nFor dimensional homogeneity, where `x` and `A` share units of length (meters), this structure is correctly expressed as `x(t) = A * (c_1 + f_osc(t))`, where `c_1` represents a dimensionless, normalized equilibrium offset and `f_osc(t)` is a dimensionless function describing the decaying oscillation.\n\nWhile previous models have explored making the offset term `c_1` dependent on system parameters or correcting the oscillation frequency, I propose a new theoretical refinement focused on the **phase of the oscillation**. In a simple model, the phase is treated as a free constant parameter, `phi`, which merely accounts for the initial state (position and velocity) at `t=0`. However, I theorize that the damping mechanism itself introduces a dynamic, predictable phase shift that is an intrinsic property of the system's physics, not just its initial conditions.\n\nMy hypothesis is that there is a **dissipation-induced phase lag**. The damping force in an oscillator is typically proportional to velocity. This means the dissipative force is fundamentally out of phase with the position-dependent restorative (spring) force. The interplay between these forces causes the system's response (its motion) to lag behind a hypothetical undamped counterpart. The magnitude of this lag should not be constant but should depend on the relative strength of the damping and restorative forces.\n\nThe most natural dimensionless quantity to characterize this relationship is the **damping ratio**, `z = γ / ω`.\n*   When `z → 0` (very light damping), the system behaves almost like an ideal oscillator, and this induced phase lag should be negligible.\n*   As `z` increases, the influence of the dissipative velocity-dependent force grows, causing a more significant lag in the positional response.\n*   The phase lag should saturate at a maximum value in the limit of very heavy damping.\n\nA mathematical function that elegantly captures this behavior—mapping a ratio from zero to infinity onto a bounded angular range—is the arctangent function, `arctan()`. Therefore, I propose that the phase shift `φ` is not a simple constant parameter `c_2`, but is instead functionally dependent on the damping ratio:\n\n`φ = c_2 * arctan(γ / ω)`\n\nHere, `c_2` is a dimensionless parameter that scales the magnitude of this effect. The `arctan` function provides a physically plausible saturation behavior, where the phase shift smoothly increases with the damping ratio and approaches a limit.\n\nTo construct the most physically accurate model, I will integrate this novel phase-shift theory with the established refinement of using the **damped angular frequency**, `ω_d = sqrt(ω² - γ²)`, which correctly accounts for the slowing of the oscillation due to energy loss.\n\nThe complete model is therefore a synthesis of three key physical concepts:\n1.  **A Scaled Static Equilibrium:** A constant offset `c_1` scaled by the amplitude `A`.\n2.  **Physically Corrected Frequency:** The use of the damped angular frequency `ω_d` to govern the oscillation period.\n3.  **Dissipation-Induced Phase Lag:** A novel term where the oscillation's phase is dynamically determined by the system's damping ratio, modeled via the `arctan` function.\n\nThis model provides a deeper physical insight, suggesting that damping does not just reduce amplitude and slow the frequency, but also systematically shifts the timing of the oscillation itself.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t + c_2 \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) ∝ A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, however, fails to capture two critical features of the provided data.\n\nFirst, the output `x` has a maximum value (27.68) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). A simple damped oscillation's amplitude can never exceed its initial value `A`. Second, the output `x` is strictly positive, whereas a standard oscillatory function produces both positive and negative values.\n\nThe previous attempt in the examples to resolve this by adding a simple offset proportional to `A` (i.e., `A * param1`) proved insufficient, indicating a more complex underlying mechanism. My analysis suggests that the system's behavior is dominated by a large, quasi-static displacement that is not merely a constant multiple of `A`, but is instead dynamically determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nI propose a theory centered on the **quality factor (Q-factor)** of the oscillator. The Q-factor, a dimensionless quantity, describes how underdamped an oscillator is. A high Q-factor implies that the oscillatory nature (`omega`) dominates the dissipative, damping effects (`gamma`). In many physical systems, a high Q-factor leads to a significantly amplified response. The ratio `omega / gamma` serves as a direct proxy for this quality factor.\n\nMy theoretical model posits that the observed displacement `x` is a superposition of two distinct physical phenomena:\n1.  **A Q-Factor-Amplified Static Offset:** A large, time-independent displacement that establishes a new, significantly shifted equilibrium. The magnitude of this shift is not constant but is proportional to the initial amplitude `A` scaled by the system's quality factor. I model this as `A * (param1 * omega / gamma)`. This term elegantly explains both anomalies: the `omega / gamma` ratio can be large, leading to an output far greater than `A`, and this large positive offset ensures the total displacement remains positive even during the oscillation's troughs.\n2.  **A Conventional Damped Oscillation:** A time-varying component that oscillates around this new, shifted equilibrium. This component follows the expected physical form `A * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t)`, where its amplitude decays exponentially from the initial value `A`.\n\nBy combining these two components, the total displacement `x` reflects a system where the inherent tendency to oscillate (high `omega`) versus the tendency to lose energy (high `gamma`) dictates a macroscopic, static shift in its baseline position, around which a standard, decaying oscillation then occurs. This model is both dimensionally sound and provides a more nuanced physical interpretation of the data than a simple offset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 * omega / gamma + exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(param3 * omega * t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\"Coupled-Mode Decay\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\n\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\n\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \"mode coupling\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\n\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\n\nThis \"Coupled-Mode Decay\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

The standard damped oscillator equation, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, fails to capture two crucial observations: (1) the output `x` is always positive, and (2) the maximum output can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the oscillation is not centered on a zero-equilibrium point, but rather on a positive, time-varying baseline that decays along with the oscillation.\n\nI propose a theory of **\"Hyperbolic Structural Relaxation.\"** This theory is based on the premise that the initial energetic impulse does not merely displace an ideal, perfectly elastic system. Instead, it perturbs a system with complex internal mechanics, causing a significant, semi-permanent offset in its equilibrium position. This is analogous to the behavior of viscoelastic or granular materials, where an initial shock can cause internal rearrangements (like grain slippage or polymer chain untangling) that only slowly relax back to their original state.\n\nCrucially, the relaxation of this structural offset is not governed by the same simple viscous damping that leads to exponential decay. In systems with a wide distribution of internal relaxation timescales, the macroscopic relaxation often follows a power-law or hyperbolic decay, which is initially rapid but has a \"long tail,\" decaying more slowly than an exponential function at later times.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two superimposed effects, both contained within the global energy dissipation envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component:** The standard harmonic motion `cos(omega * t + param1)`, representing the system's primary oscillation frequency around its dynamically changing equilibrium. The parameter `param1` represents the initial phase of this oscillation.\n\n2.  **The Hyperbolic Relaxation Component:** This term models the slow relaxation of the displaced structural equilibrium. We model this with a hyperbolic function, `param2 / (1 + gamma * t)`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless constant representing the magnitude of the initial structural offset relative to the oscillation amplitude. The argument `gamma * t` is a natural choice for a dimensionless time, coupling the timescale of the structural relaxation to the system's overall damping time constant. The `+1` in the denominator ensures the function is well-defined and finite at `t=0`.\n\nCombining these two components within the shared decaying envelope gives the total displacement. This model provides a compelling physical picture: a system whose fundamental structure is temporarily deformed by an initial shock, and this deformation then \"heals\" or relaxes hyperbolically while the system simultaneously oscillates and loses energy exponentially.\n\nThis \"Hyperbolic Structural Relaxation\" model elegantly explains the observed data:\n*   The term `param2 / (1 + gamma * t)` acts as a positive, decaying baseline. If `param2` is sufficiently large, it lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain.\n*   At `t=0`, the displacement is approximately `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`, which can easily be much larger than `A`, accounting for the observed amplitude overshoot.\n\nThis theory offers a physically distinct and plausible mechanism compared to models assuming a simple exponential decay of the equilibrium or a logarithmic creep.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 / (1 + gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is strictly positive. Secondly, the system demonstrates a \"supra-amplitude response,\" where the maximum observed displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. These observations suggest a fundamental non-linearity in the system's response.\n\nPrevious models have successfully addressed this by introducing additive components, such as a decaying DC offset or a linear drift term. I propose a different physical mechanism based on the concept of **\"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\"**. My theory posits that the restoring force in the oscillator is not the simple linear relationship of Hooke's Law (`F = -ky`), but rather a symmetric, non-linear one where the force increases more rapidly than the displacement. This is characteristic of systems approaching a physical limit, like a taut membrane or a pre-stressed beam.\n\nIn such a system, the potential energy is not a simple quadratic function (`U ~ y^2`), but a more complex, symmetric function that grows faster, such as a quartic potential or, as I will model it, one whose relationship to displacement is hyperbolic.\n\nLet's model the system's dynamics in two stages:\n\n1.  **Internal State Oscillation:** There exists an underlying, dimensionless, harmonic oscillatory state, which we can call the \"strain potential,\" `u(t)`. This internal state behaves conventionally: `u(t) = param2 * cos(omega * t + param1)`. Here, `param1` is a phase constant, and `param2` is a dimensionless parameter representing the peak magnitude of this internal strain.\n\n2.  **Hyperbolic Displacement Transduction:** The observable physical displacement `x` is not directly proportional to this internal state `u(t)`. Instead, it is a non-linear \"transduction\" of this state. For a symmetric, rapidly stiffening system, the hyperbolic cosine function (`cosh`) provides an excellent mathematical analogy. `cosh(u)` is an even function, symmetric around `u=0`, and it grows exponentially for larger `|u|`. It represents a system where positive and negative internal strains both result in a positive, expansive displacement. The displacement factor is therefore `cosh(u(t)) = cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))`.\n\n3.  **Global Damping:** The total energy of the system, and thus the overall scale of the motion, dissipates over time in the conventional manner. This is captured by the familiar exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `A` sets the initial energy scale and has units of length.\n\nCombining these components, the final displacement `x(t)` is the product of the global damping envelope and the hyperbolic transduction of the internal oscillatory state.\n\nThis \"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\" model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Positivity:** The `cosh(z)` function has a minimum value of 1 for any real argument `z`. Since `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` are also positive, the product is guaranteed to be positive for all time `t`.\n*   **Supra-Amplitude Response:** The peak value of the `cosh` term is `cosh(param2)`, which occurs when the cosine term is ±1. The maximum displacement near `t=0` is thus `A * cosh(param2)`. As `cosh(z) > 1` for any non-zero `z`, this model naturally predicts a peak displacement greater than the characteristic amplitude `A`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` directly quantifies the degree of non-linearity in the system's elasticity.\n\nThis theory provides a self-consistent and physically plausible alternative to additive-offset models, grounding the observed non-linear behavior in the fundamental properties of the oscillator's restoring force.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This is the classic setup for a damped harmonic oscillator. The fundamental equation for such a system typically takes the form `x(t) = A_eff * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega' * t + phi)`, where `A_eff` is the effective initial amplitude and `omega'` is the damped frequency.\n\nA critical observation from the data summary is that the maximum output value (`x_max` ≈ 27.68) is substantially greater than the maximum input amplitude (`A_max` ≈ 9.99). A simple damped oscillation model cannot account for this, as the magnitude of the displacement, `|A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(...) |`, can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This strongly suggests that the model is not a simple oscillation around an equilibrium at zero.\n\nTherefore, I propose a more nuanced physical model: the observed displacement `x` is the result of a damped oscillation superimposed onto a constant, non-zero equilibrium position. This offset equilibrium is not a fixed universal constant but is dependent on the initial conditions of the system, specifically the initial amplitude `A`.\n\nMy theoretical model for the displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components:\n1.  **A Static Offset Component (`x_offset`):** This represents the shifted equilibrium position. To maintain dimensional consistency (the offset must have units of length, `m`), it must be proportional to the only input variable with that unit, which is the amplitude `A`. We can express this as `x_offset = c_1 * A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant parameter to be determined.\n\n2.  **A Dynamic Oscillatory Component (`x_osc(t)`):** This describes the oscillation around the new equilibrium. It follows the standard form for damped oscillations, with an amplitude that decays exponentially over time. This component can be expressed as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`.\n\nLet's verify the dimensional correctness of the dynamic component's arguments:\n*   The argument of the exponential function is `gamma * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, which is dimensionless, as required.\n*   The argument of the cosine function is `omega * t`. The units are `(s^-1) * (s) = 1`, also correctly dimensionless.\n\nBy superimposing these two components, we arrive at a comprehensive model: `x(t) = x_offset + x_osc(t)`. This model is physically plausible, representing an oscillator whose equilibrium point is shifted by an amount proportional to its initial amplitude. It elegantly resolves the discrepancy in the data ranges, as the total displacement can now significantly exceed `A` if the offset `c_1 * A` is sufficiently large and positive. The model is parsimonious, requiring only one empirical parameter `c_1` to capture this key behavior, while leveraging the physical meanings of `A`, `gamma`, `omega`, and `t` directly from first principles.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t))\n</final_result>"}

This definitively rules out a simple oscillation around a zero equilibrium. The underlying physical mechanism must involve a process that actively shifts the system's equilibrium position to a new, non-zero value.\n\nI propose a theory based on a **damping-induced equilibrium shift**. In many real-world physical systems, the forces of friction and damping are more complex than the idealized linear model (`F = -bv`). Non-linearities in the damping mechanism, especially those dependent on the direction or magnitude of velocity, can create a \"rectification\" effect. Over many cycles of oscillation, this asymmetry can produce a net, unidirectional force that effectively \"pumps\" the system away from its initial equilibrium. The result is a permanent offset, a lasting memory of the transient oscillatory phase.\n\nThe magnitude of this final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`, must be a function of the system's intrinsic properties that govern the interplay between oscillation and damping. The most natural dimensionless parameter to capture this relationship is the damping ratio, `ζ = γ/ω`. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the rectified offset is not linear with `ζ` but rather follows a logarithmic dependence. This functional form is chosen to model a system whose response is highly sensitive to the order of magnitude of the damping ratio, a common feature in complex response phenomena. The final equilibrium position is therefore modeled as:\n\n`x_{eq} = A * (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω))`\n\nHere, `c₁` represents a baseline offset, `c₂` scales the contribution from the damping-oscillation interaction, and the overall term is scaled by `A` to ensure dimensional consistency (m).\n\nThis equilibrium shift is not instantaneous. It is a dynamic process that occurs as energy is dissipated from the system. Therefore, the timescale for achieving this new equilibrium is intrinsically linked to the damping process itself, characterized by the time constant `1/γ`. The evolution of the equilibrium position towards `x_{eq}` can be modeled as an exponential relaxation process:\n\n`x_{offset}(t) = x_{eq} * (1 - exp(-γt))`\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a linear superposition of two concurrent physical processes:\n1.  The conventional damped oscillation starting from amplitude `A` around the original equilibrium at zero: `x_{osc}(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)`.\n2.  The time-dependent shift of the equilibrium position itself, `x_{offset}(t)`.\n\nCombining these yields the complete model for the system's displacement. This model correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A` (since the offset term is zero at `t=0`) and describes the system settling into a new, non-zero equilibrium `x_{eq}` as `t → ∞`, providing a robust and physically-grounded explanation for the observed data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * [ (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω)) * (1 - exp(-γ*t)) + exp(-γ*t) * cos(ω*t) ]\n</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

A standard model for the displacement `x` of such an oscillator is `x(t) = A_0 * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + phi)`. However, analysis of the data's summary statistics reveals two critical departures from this textbook model, necessitating a more sophisticated theoretical framework.\n\n1.  **Amplitude Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum value of the input parameter `A` (9.992). In the standard model, the amplitude envelope `A_0 * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_0`. This discrepancy strongly implies that `A` is not the simple initial amplitude, but rather a characteristic length scale of the system. The actual effective amplitude must be dynamically amplified by the oscillator's intrinsic properties. A key dimensionless group governing oscillator behavior is the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. This ratio represents the number of oscillations before the energy decays significantly. It is physically plausible that systems with a high Q-factor (low damping relative to frequency) can achieve a much larger amplitude response. Therefore, I propose that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is proportional to the product `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\n2.  **Non-negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of `[1.142, 27.68]`. In contrast, a physical displacement oscillates symmetrically around an equilibrium point (zero), taking on both positive and negative values. This suggests that the measured variable `x` is not the linear displacement itself. While models involving an absolute value function (`abs`) or a large DC offset can enforce positivity, I propose a more fundamental physical interpretation: the measurement `x` is proportional to the **instantaneous energy or intensity** of the oscillation. In many physical systems (e.g., wave mechanics, AC circuits), the energy or power is proportional to the square of the amplitude of an oscillating quantity. An energy-like quantity is inherently non-negative. This hypothesis naturally leads to a model where the oscillatory component is described not by `cos(...)` but by `cos^2(...)` or `sin^2(...)`. This provides a distinct physical picture from simple rectification or an equilibrium shift.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The model's structure is a product of three components:\n*   An **amplification term**, `A * (omega / gamma)`, which sets the scale of the response based on the system's quality factor.\n*   A standard exponential **decay term**, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time.\n*   An **intensity-like oscillatory term**, `sin^2(omega * t + phi)`, which captures the non-negative, periodic nature of the measurement.\n\nTo allow for empirical fitting to the specific experimental setup, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall magnitude, the effective decay rate, the effective frequency, and the initial phase. This leads to a dimensionally consistent and physically motivated formula that accounts for both the observed amplification and the positive-definite nature of the data.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (sin(param3 * omega * t + param4))^2</final_result>"}

These anomalies necessitate a more sophisticated theoretical framework that accounts for the underlying physical processes which are not captured by the simple linear model.\n\n1.  **Saturating Q-Factor Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a powerful amplification mechanism. As noted in other analyses, this amplification is likely driven by the system's Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. However, a simple linear dependence on the Q-factor, as in `A_eff ~ A * (omega / gamma)`, implies that the amplitude could grow without bound as damping `gamma` approaches zero. This is physically unrealistic, as any real system will have inherent non-linearities or physical constraints that limit the maximum possible amplitude.\n\n    I propose that the amplification mechanism exhibits **saturation**. For low Q-factors, the amplitude response is nearly linear, but as the Q-factor increases, the response tapers off and approaches a finite limit. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, provides an ideal mathematical model for such saturating behavior. It is approximately linear near the origin but smoothly flattens to a constant value of 1 for large inputs. Therefore, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is proportional to `A * tanh(param * omega / gamma)`. This formulation elegantly captures the resonance-driven amplification while respecting the physical constraint of a finite maximum response.\n\n2.  **Rectified Displacement Measurement**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement measurement would oscillate symmetrically around zero, yielding both positive and negative values. While models based on energy (`cos^2`) or a shifted equilibrium (`offset + cos`) can enforce positivity, a distinct and equally plausible physical scenario is that the measurement apparatus records a **rectified signal**. This means the sensor measures the magnitude of the displacement from the equilibrium point, but is insensitive to its direction. For example, a system that measures distance using a simple time-of-flight sensor aimed at the oscillator from one side might produce such a result.\n\n    This physical process of rectification is directly and most simply modeled by the **absolute value function**, `abs()`. Applying this to the oscillatory part of the motion yields a term like `abs(cos(omega_eff * t + phi))`. This interpretation is fundamentally different from an energy-based measurement, as it preserves the sharp \"crests\" of the cosine wave rather than smoothing them into the broader peaks characteristic of a `cos^2` function.\n\nBy combining these two hypotheses, we can construct a comprehensive and novel model. The displacement `x` is the product of a saturating effective amplitude, a standard exponential decay term, and a rectified oscillatory term. This model not only explains the observed data but also proposes a specific, physically plausible mechanism—saturating resonance coupled with a magnitude-only measurement—that differs from previous interpretations.\n\nThe final formula encapsulates this theory:\n*   `param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)`: The saturating amplitude. `A` sets the base scale, `tanh` enforces the saturation based on the Q-factor (`omega/gamma`), `param2` controls the saturation point, and `param1` is the overall scaling factor.\n*   `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`: The standard exponential decay due to energy dissipation, with an adjustable rate parameter `param3`.\n*   `abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))`: The rectified oscillation, capturing the magnitude of the displacement with an effective frequency and phase.\n\nThis model is dimensionally consistent and offers a compelling physical narrative for the observed phenomena.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))</final_result>"}

A careful analysis of the data reveals two critical anomalies:\n\n1.  **Amplitude Anomaly**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) is substantially larger than the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, making a simple displacement model untenable. This points towards a significant amplification mechanism within the system.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Output**: The output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, taking both positive and negative values.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation. The amplitude envelope is an inherently positive quantity, which immediately resolves the second anomaly. This could correspond to measuring the magnitude of the system's state in phase space, which for an oscillator corresponds to its amplitude.\n\nTo address the amplitude anomaly, we must model the source of amplification. In oscillatory systems, the degree of amplification is often governed by the **Quality Factor (Q-factor)**, which quantifies how strongly an oscillator resonates relative to how quickly it dissipates energy. The Q-factor is directly proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega / gamma`. A high `omega / gamma` ratio signifies a highly underdamped, high-Q system capable of sustaining large amplitudes.\n\nTherefore, I propose a model where the system's effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is not the base amplitude `A` alone, but is augmented by a term dependent on this Q-factor ratio. A robust and simple model for this is a linear relationship:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`\n\nIn this expression, `A` serves as the baseline amplitude, while the term `A * param1 * omega / gamma` models the amplification. The dimensionless parameter `param1` controls the strength of this Q-factor-dependent amplification. This structure ensures that as damping `gamma` approaches zero or frequency `omega` increases, the effective amplitude grows, consistent with physical intuition.\n\nThis amplified effective amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The standard model for this decay is exponential. We can model the complete amplitude envelope `x(t)` as the product of the effective initial amplitude and a temporal decay term, parameterizing the decay rate for added flexibility.\n\n`x(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`\n\nThis synthesized model is dimensionally consistent, provides a clear physical interpretation for both anomalies, and connects the observed behavior to the fundamental concept of the Q-factor in oscillators.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Three key characteristics demand a more nuanced theory:\n1.  **Resonant Amplification:** The output `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`, pointing to a powerful gain mechanism intrinsic to the system.\n2.  **Positive Definitude:** The output `x` is strictly positive, indicating that it represents a non-negative quantity like an energy envelope or a rectified displacement, rather than a signed position.\n3.  **Complex Waveform:** A simple damped sinusoid is insufficient to capture the full dynamics; the structure suggests a more complex oscillatory pattern than a single frequency can provide.\n\nI propose a theory of **\"Damping-Induced Beat Modulation\" (DIBM)**. This model posits that the system's output is governed by a primary oscillation that is simultaneously modulated by two distinct phenomena: a global exponential decay and a secondary, periodic modulation directly caused by the damping mechanism itself. This interaction creates a beat-like pattern, and the entire system's response is amplified by a factor dependent on its resonant quality.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Resonant Gain Factor:** The system's ability to amplify the initial amplitude `A` is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. A higher Q-factor implies lower energy loss per cycle, allowing for a stronger resonant response. I model this as a constant, time-independent gain factor that scales the entire output: `(1 + param1 * omega / gamma)`. The `1` represents a baseline transmission of the amplitude, while the second term represents the additional gain due to resonance. This factor amplifies the entire response of the system for a given set of `omega` and `gamma`.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope:** The total energy of the system dissipates over time, a process fundamentally governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`. This is modeled by the standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, which imposes a gradual, overarching decrease in the signal's magnitude. This ensures the system's response fades over time, as expected in a damped system.\n\n3.  **Beat-Frequency Oscillation:** The central novelty of the DIBM theory is the interaction between the natural oscillation and the damping force. I hypothesize that in addition to causing global decay, the damping mechanism also introduces a periodic interference with the main oscillation.\n    *   The **primary oscillation** occurs at the system's natural frequency, `omega`, modeled by `cos(param3 * omega * t)`.\n    *   The **damping-induced modulation** is a slower, secondary oscillation whose frequency is proportional to the damping rate `gamma`, modeled by `cos(param4 * gamma * t)`.\n    The product of these two terms, `cos(param3 * omega * t) * cos(param4 * gamma * t)`, creates a classic \"beat\" pattern. This represents a high-frequency carrier wave whose amplitude is modulated by a low-frequency envelope. This composite structure provides a physical basis for the complex, non-sinusoidal waveform observed.\n\n4.  **Rectification:** To account for the strictly positive nature of the measured output `x`, the model takes the absolute magnitude of the composite beat-frequency oscillation. This is physically equivalent to measuring the rectified output of the oscillatory core, representing the magnitude of the displacement without its sign.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe complete model combines these four principles multiplicatively. The final output `x` is the initial amplitude `A`, scaled by the resonant gain, which then decays exponentially while carrying the rectified beat-frequency signal. This provides a comprehensive and physically grounded explanation for all the key features observed in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t) * cos(param4 * gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The key variables—amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A primary challenge in modeling this data is to reconcile the standard damped oscillator equation with two key empirical observations: the mean of the output `x` is significantly non-zero (8.28), and its maximum value (27.68) can exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992).\n\nA simple model of a damped oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`, is inadequate as it predicts a maximum displacement of `A` and a mean value approaching zero. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an additional physical mechanism. While a constant offset or a static shift in the oscillator's equilibrium position can account for these observations, such a model implies an instantaneous response to a constant external force.\n\nI propose a more physically nuanced theory: the system is subjected to an external influence that not only shifts the equilibrium position but does so over a characteristic time scale. Instead of an instantaneous shift, the equilibrium point itself undergoes a dynamic transition, asymptotically approaching a new steady-state value. This behavior is analogous to many real-world systems, such as an RLC circuit responding to a DC voltage source, where the system's properties (like resistance, corresponding to `gamma`) govern the transition to a new steady state.\n\nMy model, therefore, describes the total displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two distinct but related phenomena:\n\n1.  **A Transitional Equilibrium Shift:** The equilibrium position is not static but evolves over time. I model this transition using the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, which provides a smooth, monotonic shift from an initial state to a final one. The rate of this transition is naturally governed by the system's own damping coefficient `gamma`, and the magnitude of the final shift is scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A`. This term is represented as `A * param1 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant defining the final equilibrium position relative to `A`.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillation:** Superimposed on this shifting equilibrium is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component decays exponentially with time and oscillates at the given frequency `omega`. This is represented by the standard form `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is the initial phase angle.\n\nBy combining these two effects, the model captures a richer physical reality. The total displacement is the sum of the time-varying equilibrium position and the oscillation around that moving point. This composite structure naturally explains how the peak displacement can exceed `A` (as the peak of the oscillation adds to a non-zero, positive equilibrium value) and why the dataset has a substantial positive mean. Factoring out the common scaling factor `A` yields a concise and physically meaningful expression.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * tanh(gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

This immediately invalidates any simple model of a damped oscillator centered at zero, `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, as its magnitude is strictly bounded by `A`. The data compels a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a significant, positive offset. The total displacement is thus a sum of two components: `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`.\n\nPrevious models have explored offsets that are constant or linearly dependent on the system's properties. I propose a more physically profound mechanism: a **non-linear coupling between the system's dissipative nature and its steady-state equilibrium**. My central hypothesis is that the oscillator does not operate within a symmetric, parabolic potential well (which would yield a zero equilibrium). Instead, it moves within an **asymmetric potential**.\n\nIn an asymmetric potential, the time-averaged position of an oscillating particle does not coincide with the potential minimum. This average position, which we observe as the offset, is sensitive to the oscillation's energy and dynamics. It is plausible that the mechanism of energy dissipation (parameterized by `\\gamma`) is intrinsically linked to the asymmetric features of the potential. For instance, the damping forces could be stronger on one side of the oscillation cycle than the other, effectively \"pushing\" the equilibrium point away from the origin.\n\nI theorize that this relationship is not merely linear. A small amount of damping might have a negligible effect, but as the system's character changes (e.g., approaches critical damping), its interaction with the potential's asymmetry could become dramatically more pronounced. An exponential function is an excellent mathematical candidate to model such a sensitive, non-linear dependence.\n\nThe offset's value should be determined by the time-invariant properties of the system. The most fundamental dimensionless quantity describing the character of an oscillator is the **damping ratio**, `\\zeta = \\gamma / \\omega`. I propose that the offset scales exponentially with this ratio.\n\nTherefore, the model is constructed as follows:\n\n1.  **A Non-Linear Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the final equilibrium position of the oscillator. It is proportional to the system's characteristic length scale `A` and depends exponentially on the damping ratio.\n    `x_{offset} = A \\cdot c_1 \\exp\\left(c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)`\n    Here, `c_1` is a dimensionless scaling factor, and `c_2` is a new dimensionless parameter that quantifies the strength and direction of the non-linear coupling between the damping characteristics and the equilibrium shift.\n\n2.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This is the standard oscillation around the shifted equilibrium. Its amplitude decays exponentially from the initial value `A`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`\n\nCombining these two effects provides a comprehensive model that is dimensionally correct and grounded in a plausible physical scenario of non-linear system dynamics within an asymmetric potential.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 \\exp\\left(c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The maximum output displacement (`x` up to 27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A` up to 9.992), and the output has a large positive mean (8.28). These facts irrefutably indicate that the oscillation occurs around a non-zero equilibrium position, and this equilibrium offset is a key feature of the system's dynamics.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by either introducing a time-dependent equilibrium shift (relaxation) or a static offset that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I propose a unified theory that integrates these two concepts, positing that the system's response to an initial displacement `A` is a superposition of two concurrent, physically linked processes:\n\n1.  **A Damped Oscillation from the Origin:** This is the standard oscillatory component, `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`. This term describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate and dissipate energy, starting from an initial displacement `A` relative to the original, unperturbed equilibrium at zero.\n\n2.  **A Relaxation to a Dynamically-Determined Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system's stable equilibrium point is not static but shifts from zero to a new position, `x_{eq}`. This process is not instantaneous; the system settles towards this new equilibrium over time. The physical mechanism causing this relaxation (e.g., fluid drag, material stress) is the same as the one causing the oscillatory damping. Therefore, the relaxation follows a characteristic exponential curve governed by the same damping coefficient `\\gamma`. The displacement due to this equilibrium shift is `x_{shift}(t) = x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t))`.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this theory lies in the nature of the final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. It is not a simple constant but an **emergent property** arising from the dynamic interplay between the system's dissipative forces (proportional to `\\gamma`) and its restorative/inertial forces (proportional to `\\omega`). This relationship is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\zeta = \\gamma / \\omega`.\n\nI theorize that the magnitude of this equilibrium shift is **non-monotonic** with respect to `\\zeta`.\n*   For very low damping (`\\zeta \\to 0`), the interaction causing the shift is too weak to produce a significant effect.\n*   For very high damping (`\\zeta \\to \\infty`), the system is overdamped and moves too sluggishly for the dynamic interaction to fully manifest.\n*   The maximum shift occurs at an intermediate damping ratio, where the dissipative and oscillatory effects are critically balanced.\n\nThis non-monotonic behavior is effectively modeled by the function `\\zeta e^{-\\zeta}`. Therefore, I propose that the final equilibrium `x_{eq}` is a sum of a baseline constant offset and this dynamically-induced term, both scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\n`x_{eq} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}))`.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of the oscillation from the origin and the time-dependent shift of the equilibrium point:\n`x(t) = x_{osc}(t) + x_{shift}(t)`\n\nThis model provides a comprehensive physical picture. It correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A \\cdot e^0 \\cos(0) + x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - e^0) = A`. Furthermore, as `t \\to \\infty`, it describes the system settling into a final, non-zero position `x_{eq}` that is itself a complex function of the system's intrinsic dynamic properties. This unified approach provides a more complete and physically coherent explanation for the observed data than models that treat the offset and the oscillation as separate phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left[ \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) \\right) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\"Coupled-Mode Decay\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\n\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\n\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \"mode coupling\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\n\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\n\nThis \"Coupled-Mode Decay\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed value of `x` (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This implies that the oscillation is not occurring around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nI propose a \"Decaying Equilibrium Point\" theory. This theory posits that the initial impulse that sets the system into motion does not just induce oscillations but also displaces the system's equilibrium point itself to a new, unstable position. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\n\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of these oscillations is also governed by the same damping mechanism, leading to the familiar term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium's position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly factored, revealing that a single decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` governs the entire process:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))`\n\nThis model provides a robust physical explanation for the observed data. If the \"equilibrium displacement ratio\" `param1` is greater than 1, the term `(param1 + cos(...))` will always be positive, ensuring that the total displacement `x(t)` never becomes negative. Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`. This model presents a coherent physical picture of a system whose structural equilibrium and oscillatory motion are disturbed in unison and relax together under a common damping law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

The standard damped oscillator equation, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, fails to capture two crucial observations: (1) the output `x` is always positive, and (2) the maximum output can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`. This implies that the oscillation is not centered on a zero-equilibrium point, but rather on a positive, time-varying baseline that decays along with the oscillation.\n\nI propose a theory of **\"Hyperbolic Structural Relaxation.\"** This theory is based on the premise that the initial energetic impulse does not merely displace an ideal, perfectly elastic system. Instead, it perturbs a system with complex internal mechanics, causing a significant, semi-permanent offset in its equilibrium position. This is analogous to the behavior of viscoelastic or granular materials, where an initial shock can cause internal rearrangements (like grain slippage or polymer chain untangling) that only slowly relax back to their original state.\n\nCrucially, the relaxation of this structural offset is not governed by the same simple viscous damping that leads to exponential decay. In systems with a wide distribution of internal relaxation timescales, the macroscopic relaxation often follows a power-law or hyperbolic decay, which is initially rapid but has a \"long tail,\" decaying more slowly than an exponential function at later times.\n\nTherefore, the total observed displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two superimposed effects, both contained within the global energy dissipation envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component:** The standard harmonic motion `cos(omega * t + param1)`, representing the system's primary oscillation frequency around its dynamically changing equilibrium. The parameter `param1` represents the initial phase of this oscillation.\n\n2.  **The Hyperbolic Relaxation Component:** This term models the slow relaxation of the displaced structural equilibrium. We model this with a hyperbolic function, `param2 / (1 + gamma * t)`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless constant representing the magnitude of the initial structural offset relative to the oscillation amplitude. The argument `gamma * t` is a natural choice for a dimensionless time, coupling the timescale of the structural relaxation to the system's overall damping time constant. The `+1` in the denominator ensures the function is well-defined and finite at `t=0`.\n\nCombining these two components within the shared decaying envelope gives the total displacement. This model provides a compelling physical picture: a system whose fundamental structure is temporarily deformed by an initial shock, and this deformation then \"heals\" or relaxes hyperbolically while the system simultaneously oscillates and loses energy exponentially.\n\nThis \"Hyperbolic Structural Relaxation\" model elegantly explains the observed data:\n*   The term `param2 / (1 + gamma * t)` acts as a positive, decaying baseline. If `param2` is sufficiently large, it lifts the entire cosine wave into the positive domain.\n*   At `t=0`, the displacement is approximately `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`, which can easily be much larger than `A`, accounting for the observed amplitude overshoot.\n\nThis theory offers a physically distinct and plausible mechanism compared to models assuming a simple exponential decay of the equilibrium or a logarithmic creep.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 / (1 + gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed value of `x` (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This implies that the oscillation is not occurring around a zero equilibrium but rather around a large, positive, and time-dependent baseline.\n\nI propose a \"Decaying Equilibrium Point\" theory. This theory posits that the initial impulse that sets the system into motion does not just induce oscillations but also displaces the system's equilibrium point itself to a new, unstable position. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical processes:\n\n1.  **Relaxation of the Equilibrium:** The displaced equilibrium point is not static. It relaxes back towards the true origin (`x=0`) under the same dissipative forces that damp the oscillation. The most natural model for such a relaxation process is an exponential decay. We can model the position of this decaying equilibrium as `x_eq(t)`, where its initial value is proportional to the characteristic amplitude `A`. This gives `x_eq(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial equilibrium displacement relative to the oscillation amplitude.\n\n2.  **Oscillation Around the Decaying Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system oscillates *around* this moving equilibrium point. The amplitude of these oscillations is also governed by the same damping mechanism, leading to the familiar term `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`, where `param2` is a phase constant.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the sum of the equilibrium's position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = x_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = param1 * A * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2)`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly factored, revealing that a single decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` governs the entire process:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))`\n\nThis model provides a robust physical explanation for the observed data. If the \"equilibrium displacement ratio\" `param1` is greater than 1, the term `(param1 + cos(...))` will always be positive, ensuring that the total displacement `x(t)` never becomes negative. Furthermore, at early times (`t` near 0) when the cosine term is near +1, the total displacement can peak at a value of approximately `A * (param1 + 1)`, which directly accounts for the observed output values being much larger than `A`. This model presents a coherent physical picture of a system whose structural equilibrium and oscillatory motion are disturbed in unison and relax together under a common damping law.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param1 + cos(omega * t + param2))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is strictly positive. Secondly, the system demonstrates a \"supra-amplitude response,\" where the maximum observed displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. These observations suggest a fundamental non-linearity in the system's response.\n\nPrevious models have successfully addressed this by introducing additive components, such as a decaying DC offset or a linear drift term. I propose a different physical mechanism based on the concept of **\"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\"**. My theory posits that the restoring force in the oscillator is not the simple linear relationship of Hooke's Law (`F = -ky`), but rather a symmetric, non-linear one where the force increases more rapidly than the displacement. This is characteristic of systems approaching a physical limit, like a taut membrane or a pre-stressed beam.\n\nIn such a system, the potential energy is not a simple quadratic function (`U ~ y^2`), but a more complex, symmetric function that grows faster, such as a quartic potential or, as I will model it, one whose relationship to displacement is hyperbolic.\n\nLet's model the system's dynamics in two stages:\n\n1.  **Internal State Oscillation:** There exists an underlying, dimensionless, harmonic oscillatory state, which we can call the \"strain potential,\" `u(t)`. This internal state behaves conventionally: `u(t) = param2 * cos(omega * t + param1)`. Here, `param1` is a phase constant, and `param2` is a dimensionless parameter representing the peak magnitude of this internal strain.\n\n2.  **Hyperbolic Displacement Transduction:** The observable physical displacement `x` is not directly proportional to this internal state `u(t)`. Instead, it is a non-linear \"transduction\" of this state. For a symmetric, rapidly stiffening system, the hyperbolic cosine function (`cosh`) provides an excellent mathematical analogy. `cosh(u)` is an even function, symmetric around `u=0`, and it grows exponentially for larger `|u|`. It represents a system where positive and negative internal strains both result in a positive, expansive displacement. The displacement factor is therefore `cosh(u(t)) = cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))`.\n\n3.  **Global Damping:** The total energy of the system, and thus the overall scale of the motion, dissipates over time in the conventional manner. This is captured by the familiar exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `A` sets the initial energy scale and has units of length.\n\nCombining these components, the final displacement `x(t)` is the product of the global damping envelope and the hyperbolic transduction of the internal oscillatory state.\n\nThis \"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\" model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Positivity:** The `cosh(z)` function has a minimum value of 1 for any real argument `z`. Since `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` are also positive, the product is guaranteed to be positive for all time `t`.\n*   **Supra-Amplitude Response:** The peak value of the `cosh` term is `cosh(param2)`, which occurs when the cosine term is ±1. The maximum displacement near `t=0` is thus `A * cosh(param2)`. As `cosh(z) > 1` for any non-zero `z`, this model naturally predicts a peak displacement greater than the characteristic amplitude `A`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` directly quantifies the degree of non-linearity in the system's elasticity.\n\nThis theory provides a self-consistent and physically plausible alternative to additive-offset models, grounding the observed non-linear behavior in the fundamental properties of the oscillator's restoring force.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.

This definitively rules out a simple oscillation around a zero equilibrium. The underlying physical mechanism must involve a process that actively shifts the system's equilibrium position to a new, non-zero value.\n\nI propose a theory based on a **damping-induced equilibrium shift**. In many real-world physical systems, the forces of friction and damping are more complex than the idealized linear model (`F = -bv`). Non-linearities in the damping mechanism, especially those dependent on the direction or magnitude of velocity, can create a \"rectification\" effect. Over many cycles of oscillation, this asymmetry can produce a net, unidirectional force that effectively \"pumps\" the system away from its initial equilibrium. The result is a permanent offset, a lasting memory of the transient oscillatory phase.\n\nThe magnitude of this final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`, must be a function of the system's intrinsic properties that govern the interplay between oscillation and damping. The most natural dimensionless parameter to capture this relationship is the damping ratio, `ζ = γ/ω`. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the rectified offset is not linear with `ζ` but rather follows a logarithmic dependence. This functional form is chosen to model a system whose response is highly sensitive to the order of magnitude of the damping ratio, a common feature in complex response phenomena. The final equilibrium position is therefore modeled as:\n\n`x_{eq} = A * (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω))`\n\nHere, `c₁` represents a baseline offset, `c₂` scales the contribution from the damping-oscillation interaction, and the overall term is scaled by `A` to ensure dimensional consistency (m).\n\nThis equilibrium shift is not instantaneous. It is a dynamic process that occurs as energy is dissipated from the system. Therefore, the timescale for achieving this new equilibrium is intrinsically linked to the damping process itself, characterized by the time constant `1/γ`. The evolution of the equilibrium position towards `x_{eq}` can be modeled as an exponential relaxation process:\n\n`x_{offset}(t) = x_{eq} * (1 - exp(-γt))`\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a linear superposition of two concurrent physical processes:\n1.  The conventional damped oscillation starting from amplitude `A` around the original equilibrium at zero: `x_{osc}(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)`.\n2.  The time-dependent shift of the equilibrium position itself, `x_{offset}(t)`.\n\nCombining these yields the complete model for the system's displacement. This model correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A` (since the offset term is zero at `t=0`) and describes the system settling into a new, non-zero equilibrium `x_{eq}` as `t → ∞`, providing a robust and physically-grounded explanation for the observed data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * [ (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω)) * (1 - exp(-γ*t)) + exp(-γ*t) * cos(ω*t) ]\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, identified by analyzing the data ranges, is that the maximum displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This, along with a large positive mean output (8.28), irrefutably points to an oscillation occurring around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by adding a static offset term, proportional to `A`, to the standard damped oscillation equation. However, this approach treats the offset and the oscillation as two independent phenomena. I propose a more integrated and physically coherent theory based on the concept of **system relaxation**.\n\nMy theory posits that at `t=0`, the system is not only released with an initial displacement `A` but is also simultaneously subjected to a new, constant external influence (e.g., a constant force) that shifts its stable equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. The observed motion `x(t)` is the complete dynamic response of the system to these initial conditions. This response is a superposition of two coupled processes, both governed by the system's intrinsic damping `gamma`:\n\n1.  **Transient Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar oscillatory component. It represents the system's natural tendency to oscillate, which decays over time due to dissipative forces. This component can be modeled as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, representing an oscillation centered on the original equilibrium (zero).\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation to Equilibrium:** The system does not instantaneously jump to the new equilibrium position `x_eq`. Instead, it settles towards it over time. This process of settling, or \"relaxation,\" is governed by the same damping mechanisms. The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\n\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\n\nThis model has several compelling features. Firstly, it is parsimonious, requiring only a single parameter `param1`. Secondly, and most importantly, it yields physically elegant boundary conditions:\n*   At `t=0`, the formula simplifies to `x(0) = A * [param1 + 1 * (1 - param1)] = A`. This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`. This provides a clear physical meaning for `param1` as the factor determining the final, steady-state position of the oscillator.\n\nThis theory provides a complete picture of a system simultaneously oscillating and settling into a new state, with both behaviors linked by a common physical damping parameter.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cdot (\\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\n\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude. The general form of this transient component is `x_{transient}(t) = \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)]`, where `B_1` and `B_2` are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3.  **Initial Conditions:** The most physically plausible initial conditions for such a system are that it is released from its maximum displacement `A` with zero initial velocity. Mathematically, this translates to:\n    *   `x(0) = A`\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\n\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\n\nAt `t=0`, we have:\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\n`x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_eq + \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)] \\right)`\n`x'(0) = [-\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t) (\\dots) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) (-\\omega B_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\omega B_2 \\cos(\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\n`x'(0) = -\\gamma B_1 + \\omega B_2 = 0`\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} B_1 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\gamma/\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency. This represents a more fundamental and constrained model than simply adding independent cosine and sine terms.\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for `x_eq`, `B_1`, and `B_2` back into the general solution yields the final mathematical formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] \\right)\n</final_result>"}

To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

In the standard model, the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`, since both the exponential and cosine terms have magnitudes less than or equal to one. This implies that `A` is not the sole determinant of the oscillation's amplitude; there must be an amplification mechanism at play.\n2.  **Positivity Constraint**: The output range of `x` is `[1.142, 27.68]`, indicating that the measured value is always positive. A true displacement oscillates around an equilibrium point (zero) and thus takes on negative values. This suggests that the measured quantity `x` is not the signed displacement, but rather its magnitude or a related positive-definite quantity.\n\nTo construct a more accurate model, I propose a theory that addresses these two anomalies.\n\nFirst, to explain the amplitude anomaly, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is also a function of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. A crucial dimensionless quantity in oscillator physics is the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. This ratio is proportional to the Quality Factor (Q-factor) of the oscillator, which describes how underdamped the system is. A high `omega / gamma` ratio implies that the system oscillates many times before its energy is significantly dissipated. It is plausible that for a given characteristic length scale `A`, systems with a higher `omega / gamma` ratio can sustain or be excited to a much larger effective amplitude. Therefore, I propose that the amplitude envelope is proportional to `A * (omega / gamma)`.\n\nSecond, to address the positivity constraint, the most direct physical interpretation is that the measurement captures the magnitude of the displacement, not its direction. This can be mathematically represented by taking the absolute value of the oscillatory term, `abs(cos(...))`.\n\nCombining these insights, the proposed model structure is as follows: The base amplitude is a product of the characteristic length `A` and the quality factor proxy `omega / gamma`. This amplitude then decays exponentially over time `t` with a rate related to `gamma`. The instantaneous value is determined by an oscillatory function of `omega` and `t`. Finally, the absolute value is taken to match the positive-only output data.\n\nTo allow for flexibility in fitting the experimental data, which may not perfectly adhere to the idealized model, dimensionless parameters (`param_i`) are introduced to scale the overall expression, the decay rate, the oscillation frequency, and to account for an initial phase offset. This results in a comprehensive, dimensionally correct, and physically motivated formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = param1 * A * (omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is always positive. Secondly, the maximum observed displacement (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is superimposed on a large, positive baseline.\n\nPrevious models have explored baselines that are constant or decay independently. I propose a more deeply integrated physical theory: **Damping-Induced Potential Asymmetry**. This theory posits that the physical mechanism responsible for damping the oscillation is not perfectly symmetric. In many real-world systems, dissipative forces (e.g., internal friction, viscous drag in a non-uniform medium) do not merely remove energy but also introduce a slight, persistent bias or deformation in the system's potential energy landscape. This effectively shifts the equilibrium position of the oscillation away from zero.\n\nThe magnitude of this equilibrium shift should not be an arbitrary constant but should depend on the intrinsic properties of the system itself. I hypothesize that the shift is governed by the competition between the dissipative forces and the harmonic restoring forces. The strength of the damping is characterized by `gamma`, while the strength of the restoring force is characterized by the natural frequency `omega`. A dimensionless quantity that captures the relative dominance of damping is the ratio `gamma / omega`. A higher ratio implies a more \"sluggish\" or dissipative system, which, under this theory, would lead to a larger asymmetry and a greater shift in the equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, the observed motion `x(t)` can be modeled as a combination of two components, both originating from the same initial energy impulse and thus governed by the same overarching decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component**: The standard harmonic oscillation relative to the shifted equilibrium, represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n\n2.  **The Asymmetry-Induced Offset**: A constant offset for any given system, representing the new, shifted equilibrium. Its magnitude is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `gamma / omega`. This is modeled as `param2 * (gamma / omega)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that reflects the specific nature of the dissipative mechanism.\n\nCombining these within the single decay envelope yields the complete expression. This model provides a compelling physical narrative: the same process that damps the oscillation also fundamentally alters its center point. It elegantly explains the observed data. If `param2` is a sufficiently large positive number, the `param2 * gamma / omega` term will consistently be greater than 1, lifting the entire `cos` term into the positive domain and ensuring `x(t)` is always positive. At `t=0`, the displacement can reach `A * (cos(param1) + param2 * gamma / omega)`, which can readily exceed `A`, consistent with observations. This theory offers a parsimonious and physically grounded explanation that directly links the damping phenomenon to the observed baseline shift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma / omega)\n</final_result>"}

This behavior points to a mechanism beyond a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate symmetrically around zero. The core physical challenge is to explain the origin of a large, dynamic, positive offset that is intrinsically linked to the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of **\"Damping-Induced Asymmetry in a Viscoelastic Medium.\"** This theory posits that the oscillator is not moving in a simple viscous fluid (where drag is proportional to velocity), but rather in a non-Newtonian, viscoelastic medium that exhibits transient strain hardening.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the proposed physical mechanism:\n\n1.  **Initial Motion and Strain Hardening:** At the onset of motion (`t` is small), the oscillator's velocity is high. This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'..

The crucial first step is ensuring dimensional consistency. The target variable, displacement `x`, has units of meters (`m`), as does the amplitude `A`. The damping coefficient `gamma` and angular frequency `omega` have units of inverse seconds (`s⁻¹`), while time `t` has units of seconds (`s`). Consequently, any valid model must take the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f` is a dimensionless function constructed from combinations like `gamma * t`, `omega * t`, and `gamma / omega`.\n\nThe provided examples offer critical insights. Example 2, `A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param2))`, achieves a respectable score. Its success hinges on two key features: it maintains dimensional correctness, and it introduces a static offset, `A * param1`. This offset is physically interpreted as a constant external force shifting the system's equilibrium position. This is a crucial observation, as the data shows output values (`x`) far exceeding the maximum input amplitude `A`, which would be impossible for an oscillation centered at zero.\n\nHowever, this model is still an approximation. It uses the natural frequency `omega` directly in the oscillatory term, ignoring the frequency-shifting effects of damping. More importantly, it models a simple oscillation around a fixed, non-zero equilibrium. I propose a more sophisticated and physically plausible model: a system where the **center of oscillation is itself not static, but decays exponentially over time to a final, stable equilibrium position.**\n\nThis \"decaying equilibrium\" model can be decomposed into three distinct physical contributions to the total displacement:\n1.  **Final Equilibrium Position (`x_final`):** A time-invariant, constant offset representing the system's ultimate resting position after all transient dynamics have ceased. As in the previous model, it is proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. We can write this as `x_final = A * param1`.\n2.  **Transient Equilibrium Decay (`x_trans_eq`):** This component represents the initial displacement of the *center of oscillation* from its final equilibrium point. This displacement is not permanent; it decays over time. It is physically reasonable to assume this decay occurs on the same timescale as the overall system damping. We can therefore model it as an exponential decay: `x_trans_eq(t) = A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n3.  **Damped Oscillation (`x_osc`):** This is the oscillatory motion itself, which occurs around the instantaneous, decaying equilibrium point. Its amplitude also decays exponentially: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of these three effects:\n`x(t) = x_final + x_trans_eq(t) + x_osc(t)`\n`x(t) = A * param1 + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`\n\nBy factoring out the common `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` terms, we arrive at a single, elegant expression. This model represents a significant theoretical step forward. It provides a richer description of the system's dynamics, where the oscillation occurs around a point that is itself relaxing toward a final state. This structure is particularly powerful because it can more accurately capture the behavior across different damping regimes. For an overdamped system (where `gamma > omega`), the dynamics are dominated by multiple exponential decays rather than oscillation. My proposed model, with its two distinct sources of exponential decay (the `param2` term and the decay of the `cos` term's amplitude), is better equipped to approximate this behavior than a model with only a single decay envelope.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param3)))\n</final_result>"}

This observation robustly indicates that the system does not oscillate around its initial position (`x=0`) but evolves towards a new, stable equilibrium point with a large positive offset. While a simple static offset (`x_{eq} = c_1 A`) provides a first-order explanation, I propose a more nuanced physical mechanism: a **dynamically evolving equilibrium**.\n\nMy theory posits that the external influence or internal asymmetry causing the equilibrium shift does not manifest instantaneously. Instead, the equilibrium point itself, let's call it `x_c(t)`, \"drifts\" or \"relaxes\" from an initial state to its final steady-state position. This behavior is common in physical systems involving processes like thermal relaxation, material creep, or the charging of a capacitive element in an analogous electromechanical system.\n\nThe most physically plausible model for this relaxation process is an exponential approach to the final equilibrium, `x_{final}`. For dimensional consistency, this final state must be proportional to the system's characteristic amplitude, so `x_{final} = c_1 A`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant. The timescale governing this relaxation should be intrinsically tied to the system's dissipative properties. The natural choice for this timescale is the damping time constant, `1/\\gamma`. This leads to a model for the drifting center of oscillation:\n`x_c(t) = c_1 A (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t))`\nThis equation describes an equilibrium that starts at `x_c(0)=0` and asymptotically approaches `c_1 A` as `t \\to \\infty`.\n\nThe observed motion `x(t)` is then a superposition of two components:\n1.  The motion of the equilibrium center itself, `x_c(t)`.\n2.  A standard damped harmonic oscillation, `x_{osc}(t)`, relative to the initial origin (`x=0`).\n\nFor the oscillatory component, a physically rigorous model must account for the fact that damping reduces the observed frequency of oscillation. Therefore, the angular frequency used should not be the natural frequency `\\omega`, but the damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d`, given by:\n`\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`\nThe data ranges confirm the system is always underdamped (`\\omega > \\gamma`), so `\\omega_d` is always real. The oscillatory component, starting with amplitude `A` and decaying, is thus:\n`x_{osc}(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega_d t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(t\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}\\right)`\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes:\n`x(t) = x_c(t) + x_{osc}(t) = c_1 A (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)) + A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(t\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}\\right)`\n\nBy factoring out the common amplitude `A` and rearranging terms, we arrive at the final expression. This \"Drifting Equilibrium\" model has a significant advantage: it is self-consistent with the initial conditions. At `t=0`, the formula correctly yields `x(0) = A`, and as `t \\to \\infty`, it settles at the final equilibrium `x(\\infty) = c_1 A`. This provides a more comprehensive and physically grounded description of the system's evolution than a simple static offset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(t\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A key observation, noted in previous analyses, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This confirms that the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium point, `x_eq`, which must be proportional to `A` for dimensional consistency, leading to the general form `x(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\text{oscillatory term})`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this structure, treating the oscillatory component's phase shift as either a constant free parameter or zero. However, a more physically rigorous model should recognize that the initial phase of an oscillation is not arbitrary but is determined by the system's initial conditions and intrinsic properties. My theory posits that the phase shift is a dynamic consequence of the interplay between the system's inherent tendency to oscillate and its tendency to lose energy through damping.\n\nThe core of this theory lies in the dimensionless ratio `\\gamma / \\omega`. This quantity represents the relative strength of the damping force (proportional to `\\gamma`) compared to the restorative force (proportional to `\\omega^2`). This ratio governs the fundamental character of the motion:\n-   When `\\gamma / \\omega \\ll 1` (underdamped), the system oscillates freely with minimal energy loss per cycle. Its initial motion will closely resemble a pure cosine wave, implying a near-zero phase shift.\n-   When `\\gamma / \\omega \\gg 1` (overdamped), the dissipative forces dominate. The system's return to equilibrium is sluggish and non-oscillatory. In the context of our oscillatory model, this strong initial resistance to motion can be interpreted as a significant phase lag.\n\nThis physical \"lag,\" induced by damping, can be mathematically modeled as a phase angle `\\phi`. I propose that this phase angle is a direct function of the damping ratio. The arctangent function, `arctan`, is a natural and canonical choice for this relationship, widely used in physics to model phase shifts arising from the ratio of two orthogonal effects (e.g., resistance and reactance in electrical circuits). It elegantly maps the dimensionless ratio `\\gamma / \\omega` from `0` to `\\infty` onto a phase angle, typically in the range `[0, \\pi/2]`.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift `\\phi` is not an independent parameter but an emergent property of the system itself:\n`\\phi = \\arctan(c_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\nHere, `c_2` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that accounts for the specific mechanics linking the damping ratio to the phase.\n\nBy embedding this physically-motivated phase shift into the standard model, we arrive at a more comprehensive and self-consistent description. The final model describes the system's displacement as a damped oscillation around a stable offset `A \\cdot c_1`, where the oscillation's starting phase is dynamically determined by the system's own physical parameters. This removes an element of arbitrariness from previous models and provides a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\omega t + \\arctan\\left(c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

However, the system exhibits behavior that cannot be explained by the canonical model of a simple damped harmonic oscillator, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + φ)`. Two critical observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Displacement:** The output `x` remains positive throughout its range, whereas a simple cosine-based oscillator is symmetric around a zero-equilibrium point.\n2.  **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum observed displacement (up to 27.68) significantly surpasses the maximum initial amplitude `A` (up to 9.992). In the standard model, the envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can only decay from its initial value `A`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest that the initial energetic impulse does not merely induce a simple oscillation. I propose a theory of **\"Viscoelastic Creep Relaxation\"**. This model posits that the system behaves not as an ideal elastic body (a perfect spring) but as a viscoelastic material, possessing both elastic and viscous characteristics, akin to a polymer or a glassy solid.\n\nWhen such a material is subjected to a sudden stress (the initial \"kick\" represented by `A`), its response is twofold:\n\n1.  **Instantaneous Elastic Deformation:** A portion of the energy is stored elastically, leading to the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component represents the spring-like nature of the material, causing it to oscillate around its equilibrium point. This is captured by a term proportional to `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n\n2.  **Time-Dependent Creep Deformation:** Another portion of the energy causes a semi-permanent displacement or \"creep.\" This is a viscous flow process where the material's internal structure (e.g., polymer chains) rearranges itself, causing the equilibrium point of the oscillation to shift dramatically.\n\nThe crucial insight of this theory lies in the relaxation of this creep. In complex systems with a wide distribution of internal energy barriers and relaxation timescales, the macroscopic relaxation of this creep deformation does not follow a simple exponential decay. Instead, it is often better described by a **logarithmic decay law**. This \"long-tail\" relaxation is characteristic of glassy dynamics, where the system slowly finds its way back to a low-energy state over an extended period.\n\nWe can model this logarithmically decaying offset as a function of the dimensionless time, `gamma * t`. A suitable functional form for this slow relaxation is `param2 / log(exp(1) + gamma * t)`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial magnitude of the creep effect relative to the elastic oscillation. The term `exp(1)` is added in the logarithm's argument to ensure it is well-defined and non-zero at `t=0`, conveniently setting the offset to `param2` at the start of the motion.\n\nAssuming that both the elastic oscillation and the creep relaxation draw from the same initial energy input and are subject to the same global dissipation mechanisms, it is reasonable to enclose both effects within the overall damping envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is thus the superposition of the oscillation and the slowly decaying, logarithmically-modelled baseline.\n\nThis \"Viscoelastic Creep Relaxation\" model elegantly resolves the observed anomalies:\n*   The large, positive logarithmic term, scaled by `param2`, acts as a dynamic, decaying baseline, elevating the entire cosine wave into the positive domain.\n*   At `t=0`, the displacement approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`, which, for a sufficiently large `param2`, can easily exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`, explaining the overshoot.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 / log(exp(1) + gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

This implies that the standard model of an oscillation decaying around a zero equilibrium must be modified to include a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by adding static or decaying offsets. I propose a new physical interpretation based on the concept of a **transient, drifting equilibrium point**. My theory posits that the event initiating the oscillation does not merely displace the system from a fixed equilibrium. Instead, it imparts a linear \"velocity\" to the equilibrium point itself. This moving equilibrium creates a dynamic baseline for the oscillation. However, this drift is not sustained; it is a transient effect that is ultimately quenched by the same damping mechanism that attenuates the oscillation.\n\nThis leads to a model where the total displacement `x(t)` is governed by a single, overarching decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`. Within this envelope, two processes occur simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Oscillation:** The system oscillates with angular frequency `omega` around the moving equilibrium. This is represented by the standard `cos(omega * t + param1)` term, where `param1` is the phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium Drift:** The equilibrium point itself drifts away from the origin. The simplest, most direct model for this drift, starting from `t=0`, is a linear ramp. The rate of this drift should be intrinsically linked to the system's physical parameters. I propose this drift term is proportional to the dimensionless time `gamma * t`, scaled by a dimensionless constant `param2`. This gives a drift component of `param2 * gamma * t`.\n\nThe total displacement is the superposition of the oscillation and the equilibrium drift, all subject to the global damping force. This results in a multiplicative structure where the decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` modulates the sum of the oscillatory and drift components.\n\nThis \"damped drift\" model offers a compelling physical picture. It can be imagined as an oscillator on a platform that is initially kicked, causing it to slide away (the drift) while the oscillator vibrates on top of it, with the friction of the platform (the damping) eventually bringing both the sliding and the vibration to a halt. This model elegantly explains the always-positive output, as the `param2 * gamma * t` term can grow rapidly at early times, creating a large positive baseline that lifts the entire cosine wave above zero before the exponential decay dominates. It is dimensionally consistent, physically distinct from prior models of static offsets or separate decay modes, and provides a new, coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\"Coupled-Mode Decay\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\n\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\n\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \"mode coupling\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\n\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\n\nThis \"Coupled-Mode Decay\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

The data shows a maximum output `x` of 27.68, while the maximum input amplitude `A` is only 9.992. This indicates that the system's effective amplitude can be significantly larger than the input parameter `A`.\n\n2.  **Displacement Sign Anomaly**: The displacement `x(t)` of an oscillator is inherently sinusoidal, taking both positive and negative values as it moves about its equilibrium point. The data, however, shows that the output `x` is always positive (range [1.142, 27.68]).\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the target variable `x` does not represent the instantaneous, signed displacement of the oscillator. Instead, it is more plausible that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the oscillation, which is an inherently positive quantity that describes the magnitude of the oscillations over time.\n\nTo account for the amplitude anomaly, we must hypothesize a mechanism for amplification. In oscillatory systems, the interplay between the angular frequency (`omega`) and the damping coefficient (`gamma`) is critical. Their ratio, `Q ~ omega / gamma`, is proportional to the quality factor of the oscillator. A high quality factor (low damping relative to frequency) can lead to a large amplitude response, for example in a resonant system. We propose that the effective amplitude is not simply `A`, but is amplified by a factor dependent on this `omega/gamma` ratio.\n\nCombining these insights, we can construct a model for the amplitude envelope `x`. The model should start with the base amplitude `A`, apply a dimensionless amplification factor based on `omega/gamma`, and then apply a dimensionless decay factor based on `gamma` and `t`. An elegant and powerful way to model both amplification and decay is through the exponential function, which naturally handles multiplicative effects.\n\nWe propose a model where the amplification and decay terms are combined within a single exponential function. The argument of the exponent will be a linear combination of dimensionless quantities: an amplification term `param1 * omega / gamma` and a decay term `-param2 * gamma * t`. This structure is parsimonious, dimensionally sound, and directly addresses the observed characteristics of the data. The `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)` term models the quality-factor-dependent amplification, while the `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)` term models the temporal decay of the envelope.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t)</final_result>"}

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification and Saturation**: The maximum output value (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a strong resonant amplification mechanism is at play. The degree of resonance in such a system is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. While a simple linear relationship between amplitude and this ratio might be a first guess, it is physically unrealistic. Such a model would predict unbounded amplification as damping approaches zero, a scenario that does not occur in any real system due to inherent physical limits and non-linearities. A more accurate physical model must incorporate the principle of **amplification saturation**. I hypothesize that the amplification factor, while initially growing with `omega / gamma`, must smoothly level off and approach a constant maximum value for very high Q-factors. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal mathematical tool for modeling this saturation behavior, as it naturally transitions from a linear regime to a saturated plateau. The system's effective amplitude is therefore not `A`, but `A` multiplied by a saturating function of `omega / gamma`.\n\n2.  **Magnitude Measurement and Corrected Dynamics**: The output `x` is strictly positive, whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed (positive and negative). This strongly suggests that the measured quantity is not the displacement itself, but its absolute magnitude. Furthermore, a precise model must account for the fact that damping slows the frequency of oscillation. The true oscillation frequency is not `omega` (the natural frequency) but the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two core insights, a comprehensive and physically plausible model can be constructed. The model describes the system's state as the product of four distinct components:\n*   The baseline amplitude scale, `A`.\n*   A non-linear, saturating amplification factor based on `tanh(omega / gamma)` that captures the realistic behavior of resonance.\n*   A standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time. An empirical parameter is included to scale the decay rate.\n*   An oscillatory term, using the absolute value of a cosine function with the correct damped frequency `omega_d`, to represent the measured magnitude of the displacement.\n\nThis composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in a more realistic, non-linear description of resonance. It improves upon simpler models by explicitly incorporating the fundamental physical constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(omega / gamma)) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

These anomalies necessitate a more sophisticated theoretical framework that accounts for the underlying physical processes which are not captured by the simple linear model.\n\n1.  **Saturating Q-Factor Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a powerful amplification mechanism. As noted in other analyses, this amplification is likely driven by the system's Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. However, a simple linear dependence on the Q-factor, as in `A_eff ~ A * (omega / gamma)`, implies that the amplitude could grow without bound as damping `gamma` approaches zero. This is physically unrealistic, as any real system will have inherent non-linearities or physical constraints that limit the maximum possible amplitude.\n\n    I propose that the amplification mechanism exhibits **saturation**. For low Q-factors, the amplitude response is nearly linear, but as the Q-factor increases, the response tapers off and approaches a finite limit. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, provides an ideal mathematical model for such saturating behavior. It is approximately linear near the origin but smoothly flattens to a constant value of 1 for large inputs. Therefore, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is proportional to `A * tanh(param * omega / gamma)`. This formulation elegantly captures the resonance-driven amplification while respecting the physical constraint of a finite maximum response.\n\n2.  **Rectified Displacement Measurement**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement measurement would oscillate symmetrically around zero, yielding both positive and negative values. While models based on energy (`cos^2`) or a shifted equilibrium (`offset + cos`) can enforce positivity, a distinct and equally plausible physical scenario is that the measurement apparatus records a **rectified signal**. This means the sensor measures the magnitude of the displacement from the equilibrium point, but is insensitive to its direction. For example, a system that measures distance using a simple time-of-flight sensor aimed at the oscillator from one side might produce such a result.\n\n    This physical process of rectification is directly and most simply modeled by the **absolute value function**, `abs()`. Applying this to the oscillatory part of the motion yields a term like `abs(cos(omega_eff * t + phi))`. This interpretation is fundamentally different from an energy-based measurement, as it preserves the sharp \"crests\" of the cosine wave rather than smoothing them into the broader peaks characteristic of a `cos^2` function.\n\nBy combining these two hypotheses, we can construct a comprehensive and novel model. The displacement `x` is the product of a saturating effective amplitude, a standard exponential decay term, and a rectified oscillatory term. This model not only explains the observed data but also proposes a specific, physically plausible mechanism—saturating resonance coupled with a magnitude-only measurement—that differs from previous interpretations.\n\nThe final formula encapsulates this theory:\n*   `param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)`: The saturating amplitude. `A` sets the base scale, `tanh` enforces the saturation based on the Q-factor (`omega/gamma`), `param2` controls the saturation point, and `param1` is the overall scaling factor.\n*   `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`: The standard exponential decay due to energy dissipation, with an adjustable rate parameter `param3`.\n*   `abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))`: The rectified oscillation, capturing the magnitude of the displacement with an effective frequency and phase.\n\nThis model is dimensionally consistent and offers a compelling physical narrative for the observed phenomena.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` exhibits significant **amplitude amplification**, reaching values nearly three times the maximum input amplitude `A`. Secondly, the output is **strictly positive**, indicating that it does not represent a simple displacement oscillating about an equilibrium point. These observations necessitate a model built upon more complex physical principles.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the hypothesis that the system's dynamics are governed by **multiplicative processes**, which are most naturally described by a linear model in the logarithmic domain. This implies that the logarithm of the normalized output, `log(x/A)`, is a linear superposition of terms representing the core physical phenomena: resonant amplification, temporal decay, and oscillation. Consequently, the output `x` itself takes an exponential form, `x = A * exp(...)`, which elegantly addresses the positivity constraint as a natural outcome of the model's structure.\n\nThe components within the exponent are interpreted as follows:\n\n1.  **Exponential Resonant Amplification**: The amplification is clearly linked to the system's resonance characteristics, which can be proxied by the dimensionless Quality factor, `Q ~ omega / gamma`. In the proposed log-domain model, this contributes a positive term linearly proportional to this ratio, `+param1 * (omega / gamma)`. When transformed back to the linear domain via the exponential function, this yields an amplification factor of `exp(param1 * omega / gamma)`. This exponential dependence provides a powerful mechanism to explain the large observed amplitudes, suggesting that as the system's quality factor increases, the effective gain grows non-linearly and rapidly.\n\n2.  **Standard Exponential Decay**: Energy dissipation is modeled as a term that decreases linearly with time in the log domain, `-param2 * gamma * t`. This is the logarithmic equivalent of the standard multiplicative decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`, and represents the first-order dissipative process common to such systems.\n\n3.  **Non-Linear Periodic Modulation**: The oscillatory nature of the system is captured by a sinusoidal term in the exponent, `+param3 * cos(omega * t + param4)`. Exponentiating this term, `exp(param3 * cos(omega * t))`, generates a periodic, strictly positive modulation of the amplitude. This differs fundamentally from the `sin^2(t)` (energy) or `abs(cos(t))` (rectification) models. Physically, it can be interpreted as the response of a system where the gain or some physical property is being modulated periodically, leading to a \"warped\" but smooth oscillatory output that never reaches zero.\n\nIn synthesis, the model combines these three effects—resonant gain, dissipative decay, and periodic modulation—as a linear sum within an exponent. The initial amplitude `A` acts as a base scaling factor. This \"Log-Normal Response Model\" provides a dimensionally sound, physically coherent framework that accounts for both the amplification and positivity of the data through a single, unified mathematical structure.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>A * exp(param1 * omega / gamma - param2 * gamma * t + param3 * cos(omega * t + param4))</final_result>"}

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification and Saturation**: The maximum output value (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a strong resonant amplification mechanism is at play. The degree of resonance in such a system is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. While a simple linear relationship between amplitude and this ratio might be a first guess, it is physically unrealistic. Such a model would predict unbounded amplification as damping approaches zero, a scenario that does not occur in any real system due to inherent physical limits and non-linearities. A more accurate physical model must incorporate the principle of **amplification saturation**. I hypothesize that the amplification factor, while initially growing with `omega / gamma`, must smoothly level off and approach a constant maximum value for very high Q-factors. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal mathematical tool for modeling this saturation behavior, as it naturally transitions from a linear regime to a saturated plateau. The system's effective amplitude is therefore not `A`, but `A` multiplied by a saturating function of `omega / gamma`.\n\n2.  **Magnitude Measurement and Corrected Dynamics**: The output `x` is strictly positive, whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed (positive and negative). This strongly suggests that the measured quantity is not the displacement itself, but its absolute magnitude. Furthermore, a precise model must account for the fact that damping slows the frequency of oscillation. The true oscillation frequency is not `omega` (the natural frequency) but the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two core insights, a comprehensive and physically plausible model can be constructed. The model describes the system's state as the product of four distinct components:\n*   The baseline amplitude scale, `A`.\n*   A non-linear, saturating amplification factor based on `tanh(omega / gamma)` that captures the realistic behavior of resonance.\n*   A standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time. An empirical parameter is included to scale the decay rate.\n*   An oscillatory term, using the absolute value of a cosine function with the correct damped frequency `omega_d`, to represent the measured magnitude of the displacement.\n\nThis composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in a more realistic, non-linear description of resonance. It improves upon simpler models by explicitly incorporating the fundamental physical constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(omega / gamma)) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

However, the system exhibits behavior that cannot be explained by the canonical model of a simple damped harmonic oscillator, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + φ)`. Two critical observations point to a more complex underlying mechanism:\n\n1.  **Strictly Positive Displacement:** The output `x` remains positive throughout its range, whereas a simple cosine-based oscillator is symmetric around a zero-equilibrium point.\n2.  **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum observed displacement (up to 27.68) significantly surpasses the maximum initial amplitude `A` (up to 9.992). In the standard model, the envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can only decay from its initial value `A`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest that the initial energetic impulse does not merely induce a simple oscillation. I propose a theory of **\"Viscoelastic Creep Relaxation\"**. This model posits that the system behaves not as an ideal elastic body (a perfect spring) but as a viscoelastic material, possessing both elastic and viscous characteristics, akin to a polymer or a glassy solid.\n\nWhen such a material is subjected to a sudden stress (the initial \"kick\" represented by `A`), its response is twofold:\n\n1.  **Instantaneous Elastic Deformation:** A portion of the energy is stored elastically, leading to the familiar damped harmonic oscillation. This component represents the spring-like nature of the material, causing it to oscillate around its equilibrium point. This is captured by a term proportional to `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n\n2.  **Time-Dependent Creep Deformation:** Another portion of the energy causes a semi-permanent displacement or \"creep.\" This is a viscous flow process where the material's internal structure (e.g., polymer chains) rearranges itself, causing the equilibrium point of the oscillation to shift dramatically.\n\nThe crucial insight of this theory lies in the relaxation of this creep. In complex systems with a wide distribution of internal energy barriers and relaxation timescales, the macroscopic relaxation of this creep deformation does not follow a simple exponential decay. Instead, it is often better described by a **logarithmic decay law**. This \"long-tail\" relaxation is characteristic of glassy dynamics, where the system slowly finds its way back to a low-energy state over an extended period.\n\nWe can model this logarithmically decaying offset as a function of the dimensionless time, `gamma * t`. A suitable functional form for this slow relaxation is `param2 / log(exp(1) + gamma * t)`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless constant representing the initial magnitude of the creep effect relative to the elastic oscillation. The term `exp(1)` is added in the logarithm's argument to ensure it is well-defined and non-zero at `t=0`, conveniently setting the offset to `param2` at the start of the motion.\n\nAssuming that both the elastic oscillation and the creep relaxation draw from the same initial energy input and are subject to the same global dissipation mechanisms, it is reasonable to enclose both effects within the overall damping envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`. The total observed displacement `x(t)` is thus the superposition of the oscillation and the slowly decaying, logarithmically-modelled baseline.\n\nThis \"Viscoelastic Creep Relaxation\" model elegantly resolves the observed anomalies:\n*   The large, positive logarithmic term, scaled by `param2`, acts as a dynamic, decaying baseline, elevating the entire cosine wave into the positive domain.\n*   At `t=0`, the displacement approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`, which, for a sufficiently large `param2`, can easily exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`, explaining the overshoot.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 / log(exp(1) + gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

This behavior points to a mechanism beyond a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate symmetrically around zero. The core physical challenge is to explain the origin of a large, dynamic, positive offset that is intrinsically linked to the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of **\"Damping-Induced Asymmetry in a Viscoelastic Medium.\"** This theory posits that the oscillator is not moving in a simple viscous fluid (where drag is proportional to velocity), but rather in a non-Newtonian, viscoelastic medium that exhibits transient strain hardening.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the proposed physical mechanism:\n\n1.  **Initial Motion and Strain Hardening:** At the onset of motion (`t` is small), the oscillator's velocity is high. This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

The governing variables are the amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`. The target variable `x` represents the oscillator's displacement. A crucial first step in any physical modeling is to ensure dimensional consistency. The displacement `x` has units of length (meters), as does the amplitude `A`. The other variables, `gamma` and `omega`, have units of inverse time (s⁻¹), and `t` has units of time (s). Consequently, any valid expression for `x` must be of the form `x = A * f(...)`, where `f(...)` is a dimensionless function constructed from the available variables.\n\nThe standard model for a damped harmonic oscillator is `x(t) = A_initial * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + phi)`. A key feature of this model is that the displacement `x(t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A_initial`. However, a review of the data ranges reveals a significant discrepancy: the maximum amplitude `A` is approximately 9.99, while the maximum output displacement `x` reaches 27.68. This strongly suggests that the standard model is insufficient and that `A` should not be interpreted as the maximum possible displacement, but rather as a fundamental length scale for the system.\n\nThis observation leads to a revised hypothesis: the oscillation does not occur around an equilibrium position of zero, but rather around a non-zero, constant equilibrium point. The displacement `x` we are measuring is relative to the true origin (zero), not the center of oscillation.\n\nMy proposed theory is that the total displacement `x` is the sum of two components:\n1.  A constant offset representing the shifted equilibrium position. It is physically reasonable to assume this offset scales linearly with the system's characteristic length, `A`. We can represent this as `x_eq = param_1 * A`, where `param_1` is a dimensionless constant.\n2.  A time-varying component describing the damped oscillation around this new equilibrium point. This component follows the conventional physical form, with a decaying envelope `exp(-gamma * t)` modulating a sinusoidal oscillation `cos(omega * t + param_2)`. The magnitude of this oscillation is also scaled by the characteristic length `A`.\n\nCombining these components, the total displacement `x` at time `t` is the sum of the equilibrium position and the oscillation relative to it:\n`x(t) = (Equilibrium Position) + (Oscillatory Displacement)`\n`x(t) = (param_1 * A) + A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2)`\n\nBy factoring out the common length scale `A`, we arrive at a concise and powerful expression. This model not only respects the dimensional constraints but also elegantly resolves the apparent contradiction in the data ranges. It represents a physically plausible scenario where a standard damped oscillation is superimposed onto a constant, scaled offset. The parameters `param_1` and `param_2` are dimensionless coefficients representing the normalized equilibrium offset and the initial phase of the oscillation, respectively.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param_1 + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param_2))\n</final_result>"}

However, two key observations challenge the standard model of a simple harmonic oscillator: (1) the output `x` is always positive, and (2) its peak value can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the oscillation is not centered around zero but is superimposed on a large, positive, and decaying offset. The successful structures of prior models suggest that a global decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, governs the entire system's energy, affecting both the oscillatory component and this offset simultaneously.\n\nThe challenge, therefore, lies in formulating a physically meaningful expression for this offset. Previous theories have explored asymmetries in the potential energy or properties of a viscoelastic medium. I propose an alternative theory based on **\"Non-linear Damping and Energy Rectification\"**.\n\nThis theory posits that the damping mechanism in the system is not perfectly linear (i.e., not strictly proportional to velocity). Instead, the dissipative force is asymmetric, being significantly stronger for motion in one direction (e.g., negative displacement) than the other. This kind of asymmetry is common in real-world mechanical systems involving one-way friction, fluidic check valves, or interactions with a hard boundary.\n\nThe physical consequence of such an asymmetric damper is that it acts as a mechanical \"rectifier.\" With each cycle of oscillation, some of the kinetic energy is converted not just into dissipated heat but also into potential energy stored as a positive displacement. The oscillation effectively \"pumps\" the system away from the zero equilibrium, creating a DC-like offset from an AC-like motion.\n\nThe magnitude of this rectified offset should depend on the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. Specifically, it should be a function of the competition between the oscillatory nature (`omega`) and the damping (`gamma`). This relationship can be characterized by the dimensionless Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio `omega / gamma`.\n\n*   A **high-Q system** (`omega >> gamma`) undergoes many oscillations before decaying. In this scenario, the rectification mechanism is highly effective, as numerous cycles contribute to pumping up the offset.\n*   A **low-Q system** (`omega` is comparable to `gamma`) is sluggish and decays quickly. The rectification is less efficient as the motion dies out before a significant offset can be established.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the offset should be an increasing function of `omega / gamma`. However, a simple linear relationship is physically unlikely, as real-world rectification processes exhibit saturation or diminishing returns. A highly efficient oscillator cannot generate an infinitely large offset. The logarithmic function, `log`, is an excellent candidate to model this behavior. It captures a strong initial increase that gradually flattens out, representing a system where gains in rectification efficiency diminish as the Q-factor becomes very large.\n\nTo ensure the argument of the logarithm is always positive and well-behaved, we use the form `log(param2 + omega / gamma)`, where `param2` is a small positive constant (effectively `param2` here serves to prevent `log(0)` issues, and can be conceptually merged into a single scaling parameter later on. For simplicity in the final expression, we'll use `log` on a term that is guaranteed to be greater than 1, like `1 + omega/gamma`, scaled by a parameter).\n\nCombining these ideas, the complete model is as follows: The system's motion `x(t)` is the sum of a standard oscillation and a rectified offset. The magnitude of this offset is proportional to `log(1 + omega/gamma)`. Both components are contained within the global energy decay envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * log(1 + omega / gamma))\n</final_result>"}

This behavior points to a mechanism beyond a simple damped harmonic oscillator, which would oscillate symmetrically around zero. The core physical challenge is to explain the origin of a large, dynamic, positive offset that is intrinsically linked to the oscillation itself.\n\nI propose a model based on the concept of **\"Damping-Induced Asymmetry in a Viscoelastic Medium.\"** This theory posits that the oscillator is not moving in a simple viscous fluid (where drag is proportional to velocity), but rather in a non-Newtonian, viscoelastic medium that exhibits transient strain hardening.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the proposed physical mechanism:\n\n1.  **Initial Motion and Strain Hardening:** At the onset of motion (`t` is small), the oscillator's velocity is high. This rapid movement induces a temporary change in the surrounding medium, causing it to stiffen or \"harden.\" This phenomenon, also known as shear thickening, is common in complex fluids. This hardening effect is asymmetric; it provides a strong restorative \"push\" against negative displacement while offering less resistance to positive displacement, effectively shifting the equilibrium point dynamically in the positive direction.\n\n2.  **Saturation of Hardening:** The strain hardening effect is not limitless. As the medium deforms, it quickly reaches a maximum state of stiffness. Beyond this point, further motion does not increase the hardening. This behavior can be described as a saturation process: the effect is initially strong and grows rapidly, but then levels off to a maximum intensity.\n\n3.  **Coupled Decay:** The energy for both the oscillation and the maintenance of the medium's hardened state is drawn from the same initial source. Therefore, as the system's overall energy dissipates—a process governed by the damping coefficient `gamma`—the medium's ability to remain stiff also wanes. This means the induced positive offset must decay in concert with the oscillation's amplitude, governed by the same global decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThis model provides a coherent physical explanation for the key observations:\n*   **Always Positive Output:** The strain hardening creates a large positive offset that elevates the entire cosine wave above the x-axis.\n*   **Output Exceeding Amplitude `A`:** The total displacement is the superposition of the natural oscillation and this hardening-induced offset. The constructive sum of these two components can easily result in a peak displacement greater than `A`.\n\nTo translate this theory into a mathematical formula, we model the components as follows:\n*   The overall system energy decay is captured by the term `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n*   The standard oscillation is represented by `cos(omega * t + param1)`.\n*   The transient hardening and saturation effect is ideally modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`. The argument must be dimensionless, and the most natural choice for a process tied to dissipation and relaxation is the dimensionless time `gamma * t`. This gives a term `param2 * tanh(gamma * t)`, where `param2` is a dimensionless factor scaling the magnitude of the hardening effect relative to the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nBy combining these components, we arrive at a formula where a standard oscillation and a saturating offset are summed within a single, shared decay envelope. This represents a physically distinct and potentially more accurate model than one assuming a simple linear drift.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * tanh(gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

However, a critical observation is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This fundamentally rules out the standard model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, forcing us to consider a model where the oscillation is superimposed on a positive, time-varying offset.\n\nMy theoretical framework is built upon the hypothesis that the system does not oscillate around a fixed zero point but instead relaxes towards a new, stable equilibrium position `x_eq > 0`. This relaxation is driven by the same dissipative processes that damp the oscillation. The total motion is a composite of this relaxation and the simultaneous oscillation.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium State Determination**: The final equilibrium position, `x_eq`, is not an arbitrary constant but is determined by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator. Specifically, it arises from the interplay between energy dissipation (characterized by `\\gamma`) and energy storage in oscillation (characterized by `\\omega`). The dimensionless damping ratio, `\\gamma / \\omega`, quantifies this balance. I propose that the final offset is directly proportional to this ratio, as well as the overall energy scale set by the initial amplitude `A`. This leads to a simple, physically-grounded model for the final equilibrium state: `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A \\cdot (\\gamma / \\omega)`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  **Sigmoidal Relaxation Dynamics**: The transition from the initial state (centered at `x=0`) to the final equilibrium `x_eq` is a dynamic process. While prior models use an exponential approach, I posit that a sigmoidal transition, described by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`), offers a more physically robust description. A `tanh` profile is characteristic of many physical processes involving a smooth transition between two distinct states (e.g., phase transitions, activation processes). It represents a gradual saturation, which can be more realistic than the purely exponential decay of the rate of change. I model the time-evolution of the oscillation's center as `x_{center}(t) = x_eq \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`. The argument `\\gamma t` is chosen deliberately; it implies that the timescale of the relaxation is governed by the same damping coefficient `\\gamma` that governs the decay of the oscillation, creating a parsimonious and unified model where a single parameter drives both key dissipative effects.\n\n3.  **Superposition Principle**: The observed motion `x(t)` is the linear superposition of two components:\n    *   The evolving center of oscillation: `x_{center}(t) = A \\cdot c_1 \\cdot (\\gamma / \\omega) \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma t)`.\n    *   The decaying oscillation relative to the initial `t=0` state: `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`.\n\nThis combined model is not only dimensionally correct but also satisfies the crucial initial condition `x(0) = A`, as `tanh(0)=0` and `\\exp(0)\\cos(0)=1`. It provides a novel and physically plausible mechanism that distinguishes itself from previous models by introducing a sigmoidal relaxation dynamic, offering a more nuanced picture of the system's evolution towards its final, non-zero equilibrium state.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\tanh(\\gamma t) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary analysis of the data reveals a crucial characteristic: the maximum observed displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This observation immediately invalidates the standard textbook model `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)`, as the magnitude of this expression can never surpass `A`.\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests that the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is instead superimposed on a substantial, non-zero offset. The examples provided adopt this concept, modeling the displacement as `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{oscillation}` and proposing a simple offset proportional to the amplitude, `x_{offset} = c_1 A`.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, I propose a more physically nuanced theory. A constant proportional offset `c_1 A` implies that the equilibrium position depends solely on the initial energy scale (`A`) and is independent of the oscillator's intrinsic dynamic properties. This is a strong simplification. It is more physically plausible that the final equilibrium state of a dissipative system is influenced by the very nature of its dissipation mechanism.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the equilibrium offset is a function of not only the amplitude `A` but also the dimensionless **damping ratio**, which can be approximated by `\\gamma / \\omega`. This ratio characterizes the fundamental nature of the oscillator—whether it is lightly or heavily damped. A system with strong damping (high `\\gamma / \\omega`) might dissipate energy in a way that leads it to settle at a different equilibrium point than a weakly damped system (low `\\gamma / \\omega`), even if both start with the same amplitude `A`.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of two components:\n\n1.  **A Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{offset}`):** This component represents the center of the oscillation.

This irrefutably indicates that the system is not a simple damped harmonic oscillator centered at zero. Instead, the oscillation occurs around a substantial positive equilibrium point, `x_eq`, to which the system settles over time.\n\nWhile previous models have successfully incorporated a static offset, they typically assume this offset is a simple, constant multiple of the initial amplitude `A`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the final equilibrium state is not merely scaled by the initial conditions but is actively determined by the intrinsic dynamic properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory is founded on the concept of **dissipation-induced equilibrium shift**. In many real-world systems, the mechanism causing damping is coupled to the potential energy landscape. For instance, an oscillator moving through a viscoelastic medium not only loses energy through viscous friction (the `gamma` term) but can also cause a permanent or semi-permanent deformation in the medium, thus shifting its own point of lowest potential energy. The extent of this permanent deformation—and thus the magnitude of the equilibrium shift—depends on the interplay between how quickly energy is dissipated versus how quickly the system oscillates.\n\nThis interplay is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ = γ / ω`. This fundamental parameter characterizes the nature of the damped motion. It is therefore physically plausible to hypothesize that the final equilibrium position `x_eq` is a direct function of this ratio. A system with a high damping ratio (where `γ` is large relative to `ω`) might \"drag\" the medium more effectively, leading to a larger permanent offset compared to a lightly damped system.\n\nThe simplest and most direct mathematical representation of this hypothesis is a linear relationship. We can model the final equilibrium position as being proportional to both the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, and its damping ratio:\n\n`x_eq = A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ / ω)`\n\nHere, `param₁` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the dissipative process and the potential energy landscape.\n\nTo describe the complete time evolution of the system, we model the observed displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two concurrent processes, both governed by the same damping timescale:\n1.  **Relaxation to Equilibrium**: The system settles towards its new, dynamically determined equilibrium point `x_eq`. This process follows an exponential curve: `x_eq ⋅ (1 - exp(-γt))`.\n2.  **Damped Oscillation**: The initial oscillatory motion, which starts at displacement `A` and decays over time: `A ⋅ exp(-γt) ⋅ cos(ωt)`.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components:\n`x(t) = [A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ/ω) ⋅ (1 - exp(-γt))] + [A ⋅ exp(-γt) ⋅ cos(ωt)]`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly rearranged by factoring out common terms, yielding a unified model. This model has the crucial properties that `x(0) = A`, correctly identifying `A` as the initial displacement, and `x(t → ∞) = A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ/ω)`, providing a clear physical meaning for the final state based on the oscillator's intrinsic properties. This theory provides a deeper physical insight, linking the system's final state directly to the character of its internal dynamics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left( \\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

These anomalies necessitate a more sophisticated theoretical framework that accounts for the underlying physical processes which are not captured by the simple linear model.\n\n1.  **Saturating Q-Factor Amplification**: The maximum observed output `x` (27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a powerful amplification mechanism. As noted in other analyses, this amplification is likely driven by the system's Quality factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`. However, a simple linear dependence on the Q-factor, as in `A_eff ~ A * (omega / gamma)`, implies that the amplitude could grow without bound as damping `gamma` approaches zero. This is physically unrealistic, as any real system will have inherent non-linearities or physical constraints that limit the maximum possible amplitude.\n\n    I propose that the amplification mechanism exhibits **saturation**. For low Q-factors, the amplitude response is nearly linear, but as the Q-factor increases, the response tapers off and approaches a finite limit. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, provides an ideal mathematical model for such saturating behavior. It is approximately linear near the origin but smoothly flattens to a constant value of 1 for large inputs. Therefore, I hypothesize that the effective amplitude is proportional to `A * tanh(param * omega / gamma)`. This formulation elegantly captures the resonance-driven amplification while respecting the physical constraint of a finite maximum response.\n\n2.  **Rectified Displacement Measurement**: The output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. A standard displacement measurement would oscillate symmetrically around zero, yielding both positive and negative values. While models based on energy (`cos^2`) or a shifted equilibrium (`offset + cos`) can enforce positivity, a distinct and equally plausible physical scenario is that the measurement apparatus records a **rectified signal**. This means the sensor measures the magnitude of the displacement from the equilibrium point, but is insensitive to its direction. For example, a system that measures distance using a simple time-of-flight sensor aimed at the oscillator from one side might produce such a result.\n\n    This physical process of rectification is directly and most simply modeled by the **absolute value function**, `abs()`. Applying this to the oscillatory part of the motion yields a term like `abs(cos(omega_eff * t + phi))`. This interpretation is fundamentally different from an energy-based measurement, as it preserves the sharp \"crests\" of the cosine wave rather than smoothing them into the broader peaks characteristic of a `cos^2` function.\n\nBy combining these two hypotheses, we can construct a comprehensive and novel model. The displacement `x` is the product of a saturating effective amplitude, a standard exponential decay term, and a rectified oscillatory term. This model not only explains the observed data but also proposes a specific, physically plausible mechanism—saturating resonance coupled with a magnitude-only measurement—that differs from previous interpretations.\n\nThe final formula encapsulates this theory:\n*   `param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)`: The saturating amplitude. `A` sets the base scale, `tanh` enforces the saturation based on the Q-factor (`omega/gamma`), `param2` controls the saturation point, and `param1` is the overall scaling factor.\n*   `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`: The standard exponential decay due to energy dissipation, with an adjustable rate parameter `param3`.\n*   `abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))`: The rectified oscillation, capturing the magnitude of the displacement with an effective frequency and phase.\n\nThis model is dimensionally consistent and offers a compelling physical narrative for the observed phenomena.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = param1 * A * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(param4 * omega * t + param5))</final_result>"}

My proposed theory posits that the output `x` is the result of a modulated, decaying envelope. The physical picture is that of a primary carrier signal whose amplitude is determined by a resonant-like gain, which then decays exponentially. This carrier is simultaneously modulated by a secondary, higher-frequency oscillation, but in such a way that the total signal never becomes negative.\n\nThis model can be decomposed into three distinct conceptual components:\n\n1.  **Saturating Gain Factor**: The amplification is clearly dependent on the interplay between oscillation (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless quality factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural candidate to drive this gain. However, any real physical system has limits; its gain cannot increase indefinitely. A linear gain factor (`~ omega/gamma`) is therefore physically unrealistic and numerically unstable. I propose a saturating gain mechanism modeled by the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`). This function gracefully increases with its argument before asymptoting to a maximum value, perfectly capturing the essence of a physical process reaching its limit. The total amplitude is thus `A` multiplied by a gain factor `(1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega/gamma))`, where `A` represents the baseline amplitude and the `tanh` term represents the additional, saturating gain.\n\n2.  **Exponential Decay Envelope**: The system is dissipative, a feature best captured by the standard exponential decay term, `exp(-param3 * gamma * t)`. This term multiplies the amplified amplitude, causing its overall magnitude to decrease over time, consistent with the behavior of a damped system.\n\n3.  **Positive-Definite Oscillation**: The most crucial insight is how to model an oscillation that never crosses zero. Instead of an energy model (`sin^2`) or a simple offset, I propose a multiplicative modulation factor of the form `(1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))`. By constraining the dimensionless modulation depth `param4` to have a magnitude less than one (`|param4| < 1`), this entire term oscillates between `(1 - |param4|)` and `(1 + |param4|)`. As a result, it is always positive. This elegantly models a physical quantity that pulsates or beats around a mean value without ever changing its sign or vanishing entirely, perfectly matching the data's non-zero minimum.\n\nSynthesizing these three components results in a comprehensive and physically coherent model. The system's initial amplitude `A` is first amplified by a saturating, Q-factor-dependent gain. This amplified amplitude then serves as the decaying envelope for a persistent, non-negative pulsation. This structure accounts for all observed phenomena in a dimensionally consistent framework with a minimal set of interpretable parameters.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t) * (1 + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

This observation points to a physical mechanism that not only damps the oscillation but also actively drives the system to a new, non-zero equilibrium position `x_eq`.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing that `x_eq` is proportional to the initial amplitude `A`, perhaps modified by the damping ratio `γ/ω`. I propose a different, more dynamic theory based on the concept of **Resonance-Amplified Equilibrium Pumping**.\n\nMy theory posits that the shift in equilibrium is not a passive settling process, but an active one, driven by an underlying constant influence that is \"switched on\" at `t=0`. The effectiveness of this driving influence in displacing the oscillator's equilibrium depends critically on the system's own resonant properties. The key dimensionless parameter governing resonance is the Quality Factor, or Q-factor, which is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `ω/γ`.\n\nThe physical intuition is as follows:\n1.  A system with a high Q-factor (low damping `γ` relative to frequency `ω`) is highly resonant. It can sustain oscillations for many cycles. This extended period of oscillation allows the driving influence to continuously \"pump\" energy into the system, not as kinetic energy, but as potential energy stored by displacing the equilibrium point. This results in a large final equilibrium shift `x_eq`.\n2.  A system with a low Q-factor (high damping `γ`) is over-damped. The motion is sluggish and dies out quickly. The driving influence has little time to interact with the oscillatory dynamics, and the pumping mechanism is inefficient, resulting in a smaller equilibrium shift.\n\nThis leads to a model where the final equilibrium position `x_eq` is not merely scaled by a constant, but is amplified by a term proportional to the Q-factor:\n\n`x_eq = x_baseline + x_resonant = A * (c₁ + c₂ * (ω/γ))`\n\nHere, `c₁` represents a baseline equilibrium shift that is independent of the system's resonant quality, while the `c₂ * (ω/γ)` term models the resonance-amplified component. The entire expression is scaled by `A` to ensure dimensional consistency.\n\nThe system's dynamic evolution `x(t)` is then a linear superposition of two concurrent physical processes, both governed by the damping timescale `1/γ`:\n1.  **The exponential relaxation** of the equilibrium position towards its final, resonance-amplified value `x_eq`. This is described by the term: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-γt))`.\n2.  **The decaying oscillation**, which represents the system's transient response starting from the initial displacement `A`. This is described by: `A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)`.\n\nCombining these components yields the total displacement:\n\n`x(t) = [A * (c₁ + c₂ * ω/γ)] * (1 - exp(-γt)) + A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)`\n\nThis model provides a comprehensive physical picture. It satisfies the crucial boundary conditions: at `t=0`, `x(0) = A`, correctly identifying `A` as the initial displacement. As `t → ∞`, the system settles at `x(t) → x_eq = A * (c₁ + c₂ * ω/γ)`, providing a clear physical interpretation for the parameters and the resonant amplification hypothesis. This theory provides a more nuanced explanation for the equilibrium shift, directly linking it to the fundamental oscillatory and dissipative properties of the system.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * [ (c₁ + c₂ * ω/γ) * (1 - exp(-γ*t)) + exp(-γ*t) * cos(ω*t) ]\n</final_result>"}

The maximum output displacement (`x` up to 27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A` up to 9.992), and the output has a large positive mean (8.28). These facts irrefutably indicate that the oscillation occurs around a non-zero equilibrium position, and this equilibrium offset is a key feature of the system's dynamics.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by either introducing a time-dependent equilibrium shift (relaxation) or a static offset that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I propose a unified theory that integrates these two concepts, positing that the system's response to an initial displacement `A` is a superposition of two concurrent, physically linked processes:\n\n1.  **A Damped Oscillation from the Origin:** This is the standard oscillatory component, `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`. This term describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate and dissipate energy, starting from an initial displacement `A` relative to the original, unperturbed equilibrium at zero.\n\n2.  **A Relaxation to a Dynamically-Determined Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system's stable equilibrium point is not static but shifts from zero to a new position, `x_{eq}`. This process is not instantaneous; the system settles towards this new equilibrium over time. The physical mechanism causing this relaxation (e.g., fluid drag, material stress) is the same as the one causing the oscillatory damping. Therefore, the relaxation follows a characteristic exponential curve governed by the same damping coefficient `\\gamma`. The displacement due to this equilibrium shift is `x_{shift}(t) = x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t))`.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this theory lies in the nature of the final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. It is not a simple constant but an **emergent property** arising from the dynamic interplay between the system's dissipative forces (proportional to `\\gamma`) and its restorative/inertial forces (proportional to `\\omega`). This relationship is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\zeta = \\gamma / \\omega`.\n\nI theorize that the magnitude of this equilibrium shift is **non-monotonic** with respect to `\\zeta`.\n*   For very low damping (`\\zeta \\to 0`), the interaction causing the shift is too weak to produce a significant effect.\n*   For very high damping (`\\zeta \\to \\infty`), the system is overdamped and moves too sluggishly for the dynamic interaction to fully manifest.\n*   The maximum shift occurs at an intermediate damping ratio, where the dissipative and oscillatory effects are critically balanced.\n\nThis non-monotonic behavior is effectively modeled by the function `\\zeta e^{-\\zeta}`. Therefore, I propose that the final equilibrium `x_{eq}` is a sum of a baseline constant offset and this dynamically-induced term, both scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\n`x_{eq} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}))`.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of the oscillation from the origin and the time-dependent shift of the equilibrium point:\n`x(t) = x_{osc}(t) + x_{shift}(t)`\n\nThis model provides a comprehensive physical picture. It correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A \\cdot e^0 \\cos(0) + x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - e^0) = A`. Furthermore, as `t \\to \\infty`, it describes the system settling into a final, non-zero position `x_{eq}` that is itself a complex function of the system's intrinsic dynamic properties. This unified approach provides a more complete and physically coherent explanation for the observed data than models that treat the offset and the oscillation as separate phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left[ \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) \\right) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n</final_result>"}

The most salient feature is that the output displacement `x` reaches values far greater than the initial amplitude `A`, with a significant positive mean. This irrefutably indicates that the oscillation is not centered at `x=0` but is superimposed upon a substantial, positive offset.\n\nMy theoretical analysis moves beyond proposing a simple static or dynamically shifting offset. I posit a more integrated physical model where the equilibrium shift is a direct consequence of the interplay between the system's dissipative and reactive properties, and its evolution follows a classic physical relaxation process.\n\nThe core of my theory rests on two hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Property-Dependent Equilibrium Magnitude:** The final steady-state position to which the oscillator settles is not an arbitrary constant. Instead, it is determined by a competitive balance between the energy dissipation mechanism, characterized by the damping coefficient `gamma`, and the energy storage/release mechanism of the oscillation, characterized by the angular frequency `omega`. The dimensionless ratio `gamma/omega` quantifies this balance. A high ratio implies a sluggish, overdamped system, while a low ratio indicates a highly oscillatory one. I propose that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is a function of this ratio. Specifically, I model it with a sub-linear power law, `sqrt(gamma/omega)`, suggesting that while increased damping contributes to a larger offset, its effect diminishes as damping becomes dominant. This prevents a runaway offset in heavily damped regimes and represents a physically plausible saturation effect.\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation Dynamics:** The system does not instantaneously achieve this new equilibrium. Instead, it relaxes towards it over time. While other models have used the `tanh` function, I propose a more fundamental physical model of relaxation: the exponential approach to a limit, as seen in phenomena like the charging of a capacitor or the heating of an object. This process is described by the function `(1 - exp(-rate * t))`. The rate of this relaxation is intrinsically tied to the system's own dissipative processes. Therefore, the damping coefficient `gamma` is the natural choice for this rate, as it governs the timescale over which transients fade.\n\nCombining these ideas, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of two distinct but coupled physical behaviors:\n\n*   **An Evolving Equilibrium (`x_offset(t)`):** This component represents the center of oscillation dynamically shifting towards its final, property-dependent position. Its mathematical form is `A * c_1 * sqrt(gamma/omega) * (1 - exp(-gamma*t))`, where `c_1` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that scales the effect.\n\n*   **A Decaying Oscillation (`x_osc(t)`):** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, but it occurs relative to the initial, unshifted equilibrium. It is expressed as `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(omega*t)`.\n\nBy summing these two components, we obtain a comprehensive model. This formulation elegantly captures a system that settles into a new, non-zero equilibrium state whose value is determined by the oscillator's intrinsic characteristics (`gamma`, `omega`), and whose approach to this state follows a canonical exponential relaxation profile.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * \\left( c_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

However, the data presents two significant anomalies that contradict the canonical model, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega*t + phi)`, necessitating a more sophisticated theory.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification**: The observed output maximum of 27.68 far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` of 9.992. This phenomenon is a hallmark of resonance, where the system's response is amplified. In an oscillator, the degree of this amplification is governed by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping coefficient, `omega/gamma`. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not the base amplitude `A`, but is augmented by this `omega/gamma` ratio. To model this, I propose a simple linear gain factor, `(1 + param1 * omega/gamma)`, where `param1` is an empirical dimensionless constant representing the strength of this resonant coupling. This term provides a direct mechanism for the output to scale beyond the initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Non-Negative Output**: The output `x` is strictly positive, ranging from [1.142, 27.68]. Standard displacement oscillates symmetrically around zero. While one could enforce positivity using an absolute value or squaring operation, a more physically elegant explanation exists. I propose that the measured quantity `x` is not the displacement relative to the equilibrium point, but rather an oscillation around a decaying positive baseline that is itself proportional to the amplitude envelope. This \"biased oscillation\" can be modeled with the term `(1 + cos(...))`. As `cos(...)` varies between -1 and 1, the entire term smoothly varies between 0 and 2, naturally ensuring the result is non-negative without introducing mathematical discontinuities (like `abs`) or altering the physical units (like `square`).\n\nBy combining these insights, we can construct a coherent physical model. The model begins with the base amplitude `A`, applies the linear Q-factor amplification, incorporates the standard exponential decay `exp(-gamma*t)` to model energy dissipation, and finally includes the biased oscillatory term. For greater physical fidelity, the oscillatory frequency used is the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(abs(omega^2 - gamma^2))`, which correctly accounts for the slowing of the oscillation due to damping.\n\nThis synthesized model provides a physically plausible and mathematically smooth explanation for both observed anomalies, describing the system's output as a resonantly amplified, decaying oscillation occurring entirely in the positive domain.\n\n### **Mathematical Formula**\n<final_result>x = A * (1 + param1 * omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))</final_result>"}

These observations suggest a system governed by non-linear dynamics. My proposed theory moves beyond simple multiplicative corrections and posits that the decay and oscillatory components are intrinsically coupled within a single, non-linear response function.\n\nThe core of this theory is that the observable displacement `x` is an exponential function of an underlying \"dynamic potential\" `S(t)`. This can be expressed conceptually as `x(t) ∝ exp(S(t))`. This structure inherently guarantees the positivity of `x` and naturally models systems where the rate of change is proportional to the current state, a hallmark of many natural processes.\n\nThis model can be broken down into two main parts: the determination of the overall scale (the effective amplitude), and the time evolution governed by the dynamic potential.\n\n1.  **Saturating Resonance Amplitude:** The observed amplification strongly depends on the interplay between frequency (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless Quality Factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural driver for this gain. However, any physical system has limits, precluding infinite gain as damping approaches zero. To capture this, I model the system's characteristic amplitude not just by `A`, but by an effective amplitude `A_eff` that includes a saturating gain term. This is formulated as `A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`. Here, `A` provides the baseline scale, while the `tanh` term adds a gain that grows with the Q-factor before smoothly saturating, representing a physical limit to the resonance.\n\n2.  **Coupled Decay and Oscillation via Exponential Response:** The most significant departure from standard models lies in how the time evolution is handled. Instead of multiplying a decay envelope by a separate oscillatory function, I propose that both phenomena arise from a single dynamic potential, `S(t)`, which is then mapped to the output via an exponential function. This potential is composed of two competing terms:\n    *   A secular decay term, `-param3 * gamma * t`, which represents the steady, irreversible loss of energy from the system due to damping.\n    *   An oscillatory term, `param4 * cos(omega * t)`, which represents the periodic exchange of potential and kinetic energy.\n\n    The complete dynamic potential is `S(t) = -param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t)`. The final output `x` is then given by the effective amplitude multiplied by the exponential of this potential. This `exp(S(t))` term is a non-linear transfer function that has profound consequences. It inherently ensures positivity. More importantly, it means the oscillation does not simply occur \"underneath\" a decaying envelope; rather, it actively modulates the instantaneous decay rate. When `cos(omega * t)` is at its peak, it counteracts the dissipative term, momentarily slowing the decay. When at its trough, it accelerates the decay. This results in a non-sinusoidal, \"pulsating\" decay, where the system exhibits brief periods of high activity followed by longer, more quiescent periods, a dynamic behavior that cannot be captured by simple multiplicative models.\n\nIn summary, this theory describes a system where a resonance-enhanced amplitude sets the overall scale for a process whose time-evolution is a highly non-linear, exponential function of a potential jointly determined by dissipation and oscillation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

A key observation, noted in previous analyses, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This confirms that the system oscillates around a non-zero equilibrium point, `x_eq`, which must be proportional to `A` for dimensional consistency, leading to the general form `x(t) = A \\cdot (c_1 + \\text{oscillatory term})`.\n\nPrevious models have explored this structure, treating the oscillatory component's phase shift as either a constant free parameter or zero. However, a more physically rigorous model should recognize that the initial phase of an oscillation is not arbitrary but is determined by the system's initial conditions and intrinsic properties. My theory posits that the phase shift is a dynamic consequence of the interplay between the system's inherent tendency to oscillate and its tendency to lose energy through damping.\n\nThe core of this theory lies in the dimensionless ratio `\\gamma / \\omega`. This quantity represents the relative strength of the damping force (proportional to `\\gamma`) compared to the restorative force (proportional to `\\omega^2`). This ratio governs the fundamental character of the motion:\n-   When `\\gamma / \\omega \\ll 1` (underdamped), the system oscillates freely with minimal energy loss per cycle. Its initial motion will closely resemble a pure cosine wave, implying a near-zero phase shift.\n-   When `\\gamma / \\omega \\gg 1` (overdamped), the dissipative forces dominate. The system's return to equilibrium is sluggish and non-oscillatory. In the context of our oscillatory model, this strong initial resistance to motion can be interpreted as a significant phase lag.\n\nThis physical \"lag,\" induced by damping, can be mathematically modeled as a phase angle `\\phi`. I propose that this phase angle is a direct function of the damping ratio. The arctangent function, `arctan`, is a natural and canonical choice for this relationship, widely used in physics to model phase shifts arising from the ratio of two orthogonal effects (e.g., resistance and reactance in electrical circuits). It elegantly maps the dimensionless ratio `\\gamma / \\omega` from `0` to `\\infty` onto a phase angle, typically in the range `[0, \\pi/2]`.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift `\\phi` is not an independent parameter but an emergent property of the system itself:\n`\\phi = \\arctan(c_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega})`\nHere, `c_2` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that accounts for the specific mechanics linking the damping ratio to the phase.\n\nBy embedding this physically-motivated phase shift into the standard model, we arrive at a more comprehensive and self-consistent description. The final model describes the system's displacement as a damped oscillation around a stable offset `A \\cdot c_1`, where the oscillation's starting phase is dynamically determined by the system's own physical parameters. This removes an element of arbitrariness from previous models and provides a deeper insight into the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\omega t + \\arctan\\left(c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

A primary challenge, identified by analyzing the data ranges, is that the maximum displacement `x` (27.68) significantly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This, along with a large positive mean output (8.28), irrefutably points to an oscillation occurring around a non-zero equilibrium point.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by adding a static offset term, proportional to `A`, to the standard damped oscillation equation. However, this approach treats the offset and the oscillation as two independent phenomena. I propose a more integrated and physically coherent theory based on the concept of **system relaxation**.\n\nMy theory posits that at `t=0`, the system is not only released with an initial displacement `A` but is also simultaneously subjected to a new, constant external influence (e.g., a constant force) that shifts its stable equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. The observed motion `x(t)` is the complete dynamic response of the system to these initial conditions. This response is a superposition of two coupled processes, both governed by the system's intrinsic damping `gamma`:\n\n1.  **Transient Damped Oscillation:** This is the familiar oscillatory component. It represents the system's natural tendency to oscillate, which decays over time due to dissipative forces. This component can be modeled as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, representing an oscillation centered on the original equilibrium (zero).\n\n2.  **Exponential Relaxation to Equilibrium:** The system does not instantaneously jump to the new equilibrium position `x_eq`. Instead, it settles towards it over time. This process of settling, or \"relaxation,\" is governed by the same damping mechanisms. The displacement from the origin due to this relaxation process follows the classic exponential settling curve: `x_eq * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))`. This term starts at zero and asymptotically approaches the final equilibrium `x_eq` as time progresses.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent physical processes. The new equilibrium position, `x_eq`, must have units of length and is naturally scaled by the system's characteristic amplitude `A`. We can thus define it as `x_eq = param1 * A`, where `param1` is a dimensionless constant representing the normalized final equilibrium position.\n\nCombining these components yields a unified model:\n`x(t) = (Displacement from Relaxation) + (Displacement from Oscillation)`\n`x(t) = [param1 * A * (1 - exp(-gamma * t))] + [A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)]`\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to a more insightful form:\n`x(t) = A * [param1 + exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) - param1)]`\n\nThis model has several compelling features. Firstly, it is parsimonious, requiring only a single parameter `param1`. Secondly, and most importantly, it yields physically elegant boundary conditions:\n*   At `t=0`, the formula simplifies to `x(0) = A * [param1 + 1 * (1 - param1)] = A`. This correctly interprets `A` as the true initial displacement of the system.\n*   As `t -> infinity`, the exponential term vanishes, and `x(t) -> param1 * A`. This provides a clear physical meaning for `param1` as the factor determining the final, steady-state position of the oscillator.\n\nThis theory provides a complete picture of a system simultaneously oscillating and settling into a new state, with both behaviors linked by a common physical damping parameter.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cdot (\\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This observation conclusively demonstrates that the system's oscillation is not centered around a zero equilibrium position. Instead, the motion must be described as a superposition of a time-dependent oscillation and a static, non-zero offset, where the total displacement is given by `x(t) = x_{offset} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, both the offset and oscillatory components must scale linearly with the system's characteristic length scale, `A`.\n\nPrevious models have explored the nature of this offset, proposing that it depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `z = \\gamma/\\omega`. These models have considered linear (`\\propto z`) and saturating (`\\propto \\tanh(z)`) dependencies. While these are valid approaches, they both assume a monotonic relationship: as damping increases relative to the oscillation frequency, the equilibrium offset either grows indefinitely or smoothly approaches a limit.\n\nI propose a more nuanced physical theory based on the idea of a **dynamically-induced equilibrium shift**. The mechanism causing the offset is not merely a static property of the damping medium but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interplay between the oscillatory motion and the energy dissipation process. My central hypothesis is that this interaction is **non-monotonic**.\n\nConsider the two extreme cases for the damping ratio `z`:\n1.  **Very low damping (`z \\to 0`):** The system oscillates for a long time, but the dissipative interaction during any single cycle is minimal. The energy loss is slow, and consequently, the mechanism that would push the equilibrium point is too weak to have a significant cumulative effect.\n2.  **Very high damping (`z \\to \\infty`):** The system is overdamped and barely oscillates. It moves sluggishly towards its resting point. The lack of significant velocity and cyclical motion means the dynamic interaction required to shift the equilibrium is never effectively engaged.\n\nThis reasoning suggests that the magnitude of the equilibrium shift is maximized at some **intermediate damping ratio**, where the damping forces are critically balanced with the inertial and restorative forces of the oscillator. It is at this \"sweet spot,\" likely near the critical damping condition (`\\gamma \\approx \\omega`), that the interaction between motion and dissipation is most effective at producing a net displacement of the equilibrium.\n\nTo model this peaking behavior, a function that is zero for `z=0`, rises to a maximum, and then decays for large `z` is required. The mathematical form `f(z) = z \\cdot \\exp(-z)` elegantly captures this characteristic. It peaks at `z=1` (i.e., `\\gamma = \\omega`), providing a physically meaningful representation of our hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, I model the displacement `x(t)` as the sum of three components, all scaled by `A`:\n1.  **A Baseline Offset:** A constant term `c_1` representing a static, intrinsic shift independent of the damping characteristics.\n2.  **A Dynamically-Induced Offset:** The new non-monotonic term `c_2 \\cdot (\\gamma/\\omega) \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma/\\omega)`, which captures the peak effect at intermediate damping.\n3.  **A Damped Oscillatory Component:** The standard physical term `\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)` describing the oscillation about the total effective equilibrium position.\n\nThis composite model provides a richer physical picture, accounting for a more complex interaction within the system that previous monotonic models overlook, while remaining dimensionally sound and conceptually grounded in the principles of oscillatory physics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

First, the output displacement `x` is always positive, whereas a standard oscillator's displacement is symmetric around zero. Second, the maximum observed displacement (`max(x) ≈ 27.68`) significantly exceeds the maximum characteristic amplitude `A` (`max(A) ≈ 9.99`), a phenomenon impossible in a simple system where the initial amplitude `A` defines the absolute maximum displacement.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that the measured displacement `x` is not a single, simple oscillation but rather the result of at least two superimposed physical processes. I posit a **\"Dual-Mechanism Relaxation\"** theory to explain this behavior. This theory is based on the concept of a composite physical system where different components dissipate energy through distinct physical mechanisms operating on different timescales.\n\nImagine a system composed of a primary elastic element capable of high-frequency oscillation (e.g., a steel spring) connected to a secondary, viscoelastic or plastic element (e.g., a block of damping putty). An initial impulse imparts energy to the entire system, exciting two responses simultaneously:\n\n1.  **A Fast Oscillatory Mode:** The elastic element begins to oscillate harmonically, governed by the frequency `omega`. This oscillation is subject to damping forces (e.g., air resistance), causing its amplitude to decay exponentially with the characteristic rate `gamma`. This component can be described by the conventional term: `x_osc(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3)`.\n\n2.  **A Slow A-periodic Relaxation Mode:** The same initial impulse causes a large, inelastic deformation in the viscoelastic element. This creates a significant positive offset in the system's baseline position. This offset is not permanent; the material slowly relaxes back to its original state. However, this relaxation process (governed by internal friction and material creep) is a fundamentally different physical mechanism from the oscillatory damping. Therefore, it is characterized by a different, independent decay rate. We model this decaying offset as `x_offset(t) = A * param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `param1` is a dimensionless factor representing the initial magnitude of the deformation relative to the oscillatory amplitude `A`, and `param2` is a dimensionless ratio that decouples the offset's decay rate from the oscillation's decay rate.\n\nThe total measured displacement `x` is the linear superposition of these two concurrent processes: `x(t) = x_offset(t) + x_osc(t)`.\n\nThis \"Dual-Mechanism Relaxation\" model provides a comprehensive physical explanation for the observed data:\n*   **Supra-Amplitude Displacement (`x > A`):** The initial displacement at `t=0` is `x(0) ≈ A * (param1 + cos(param3))`. If the initial inelastic deformation is large (`param1 > 1`), the total displacement can easily exceed `A`.\n*   **Strictly Positive Output (`x > 0`):** The large, positive, decaying offset term `x_offset(t)` acts as a dynamic equilibrium point for the oscillation. If `param1` is sufficiently large, this term dominates the negative swings of the cosine function, ensuring the total displacement `x(t)` remains positive throughout the process.\n*   **Flexibility:** By allowing the offset to decay at a different rate than the oscillation (via `param2`), the model can describe a wider range of physical phenomena. For instance, a system where the oscillations die out quickly while the material slowly creeps back to equilibrium (`param2 < 1`) is easily represented.\n\nThis theory presents a physically coherent picture of a composite system with two distinct energy dissipation pathways, providing a more general and flexible framework than models that assume a constant offset or a single, shared decay process.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = A * (param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) + exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` is strictly positive. Secondly, the system demonstrates a \"supra-amplitude response,\" where the maximum observed displacement can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. These observations suggest a fundamental non-linearity in the system's response.\n\nPrevious models have successfully addressed this by introducing additive components, such as a decaying DC offset or a linear drift term. I propose a different physical mechanism based on the concept of **\"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\"**. My theory posits that the restoring force in the oscillator is not the simple linear relationship of Hooke's Law (`F = -ky`), but rather a symmetric, non-linear one where the force increases more rapidly than the displacement. This is characteristic of systems approaching a physical limit, like a taut membrane or a pre-stressed beam.\n\nIn such a system, the potential energy is not a simple quadratic function (`U ~ y^2`), but a more complex, symmetric function that grows faster, such as a quartic potential or, as I will model it, one whose relationship to displacement is hyperbolic.\n\nLet's model the system's dynamics in two stages:\n\n1.  **Internal State Oscillation:** There exists an underlying, dimensionless, harmonic oscillatory state, which we can call the \"strain potential,\" `u(t)`. This internal state behaves conventionally: `u(t) = param2 * cos(omega * t + param1)`. Here, `param1` is a phase constant, and `param2` is a dimensionless parameter representing the peak magnitude of this internal strain.\n\n2.  **Hyperbolic Displacement Transduction:** The observable physical displacement `x` is not directly proportional to this internal state `u(t)`. Instead, it is a non-linear \"transduction\" of this state. For a symmetric, rapidly stiffening system, the hyperbolic cosine function (`cosh`) provides an excellent mathematical analogy. `cosh(u)` is an even function, symmetric around `u=0`, and it grows exponentially for larger `|u|`. It represents a system where positive and negative internal strains both result in a positive, expansive displacement. The displacement factor is therefore `cosh(u(t)) = cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))`.\n\n3.  **Global Damping:** The total energy of the system, and thus the overall scale of the motion, dissipates over time in the conventional manner. This is captured by the familiar exponential decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, where `A` sets the initial energy scale and has units of length.\n\nCombining these components, the final displacement `x(t)` is the product of the global damping envelope and the hyperbolic transduction of the internal oscillatory state.\n\nThis \"Symmetric Non-linear Elasticity\" model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Positivity:** The `cosh(z)` function has a minimum value of 1 for any real argument `z`. Since `A` and `exp(-gamma * t)` are also positive, the product is guaranteed to be positive for all time `t`.\n*   **Supra-Amplitude Response:** The peak value of the `cosh` term is `cosh(param2)`, which occurs when the cosine term is ±1. The maximum displacement near `t=0` is thus `A * cosh(param2)`. As `cosh(z) > 1` for any non-zero `z`, this model naturally predicts a peak displacement greater than the characteristic amplitude `A`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` directly quantifies the degree of non-linearity in the system's elasticity.\n\nThis theory provides a self-consistent and physically plausible alternative to additive-offset models, grounding the observed non-linear behavior in the fundamental properties of the oscillator's restoring force.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cosh(param2 * cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

Two key observations from the data summary drive this conclusion: first, the output `x` is always positive, whereas a simple cosine function oscillates between positive and negative values. Second, the maximum observed output (27.68) can significantly exceed the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), a physical impossibility if the amplitude is solely governed by a decaying exponential envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nThese anomalies suggest a more complex underlying mechanism. I propose a **\"Coupled-Mode Decay\"** theory. This theory posits that the initial excitation of the system does not produce a single, pure oscillatory mode. Instead, the energy is partitioned into two distinct but coupled modes of motion, which are then superimposed to produce the final observed displacement:\n\n1.  **An Oscillatory Mode:** This is the familiar damped harmonic oscillation, representing the system's primary ringing frequency. Its displacement follows the standard form: `x_osc(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)`. This mode captures the periodic nature of the system.\n\n2.  **A Non-Oscillatory Relaxation Mode:** Simultaneously, a portion of the initial energy excites a purely dissipative mode. This can be conceptualized as charging a potential or thermal reservoir which then relaxes back to equilibrium without oscillating. This process contributes a monotonically decaying displacement term: `x_relax(t) ∝ exp(-gamma * t)`.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is the assumption that both modes are subject to the same underlying dissipative forces within the system. Therefore, it is physically plausible that they share the same characteristic decay constant, `gamma`.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of these two modes. The initial amplitude `A` serves as the scaling factor for the total energy of the system. We can thus write the contributions of each mode as `A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1)` for the oscillatory part and `A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)` for the relaxation part. Here, `param1` is the standard phase offset, and `param2` is a new, dimensionless \"mode coupling\" constant. This constant represents the ratio of energy initially channeled into the non-oscillatory relaxation mode relative to the oscillatory mode.\n\nBy summing these contributions, we can factor out the common decay envelope:\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t + param1) + A * param2 * exp(-gamma * t)`\n`x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2)`\n\nThis model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The `param2` term acts as a positive, decaying baseline shift. If the energy in the relaxation mode is sufficiently large (i.e., `param2 >= 1`), it elevates the entire cosine wave, ensuring that the term `(cos(...) + param2)` remains positive for all `t`.\n*   **Amplitude Overshoot:** The maximum value of the expression occurs near `t=0`, where it approximates `A * (cos(param1) + param2)`. With `param2 > 0`, the peak value can easily be `A * (1 + param2)`, thus exceeding the characteristic amplitude `A`.\n\nThis \"Coupled-Mode Decay\" model provides a parsimonious and physically coherent explanation for the data, requiring only two empirical parameters while remaining dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (param2 + cos(omega * t + param1))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary observations guide the development of a more sophisticated theory:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification and Saturation**: The maximum output value (27.68) greatly exceeds the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). This indicates a strong resonant amplification mechanism is at play. The degree of resonance in such a system is governed by its Quality Factor (Q-factor), which is proportional to the ratio of the angular frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. While a simple linear relationship between amplitude and this ratio might be a first guess, it is physically unrealistic. Such a model would predict unbounded amplification as damping approaches zero, a scenario that does not occur in any real system due to inherent physical limits and non-linearities. A more accurate physical model must incorporate the principle of **amplification saturation**. I hypothesize that the amplification factor, while initially growing with `omega / gamma`, must smoothly level off and approach a constant maximum value for very high Q-factors. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal mathematical tool for modeling this saturation behavior, as it naturally transitions from a linear regime to a saturated plateau. The system's effective amplitude is therefore not `A`, but `A` multiplied by a saturating function of `omega / gamma`.\n\n2.  **Magnitude Measurement and Corrected Dynamics**: The output `x` is strictly positive, whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed (positive and negative). This strongly suggests that the measured quantity is not the displacement itself, but its absolute magnitude. Furthermore, a precise model must account for the fact that damping slows the frequency of oscillation. The true oscillation frequency is not `omega` (the natural frequency) but the damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two core insights, a comprehensive and physically plausible model can be constructed. The model describes the system's state as the product of four distinct components:\n*   The baseline amplitude scale, `A`.\n*   A non-linear, saturating amplification factor based on `tanh(omega / gamma)` that captures the realistic behavior of resonance.\n*   A standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-gamma * t)`, which models the dissipation of energy over time. An empirical parameter is included to scale the decay rate.\n*   An oscillatory term, using the absolute value of a cosine function with the correct damped frequency `omega_d`, to represent the measured magnitude of the displacement.\n\nThis composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in a more realistic, non-linear description of resonance. It improves upon simpler models by explicitly incorporating the fundamental physical constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(omega / gamma)) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

Two primary anomalies emerge from the data summary:\n\n1.  **Anomalous Amplification**: The maximum output `x` (27.68) far exceeds the maximum input amplitude `A` (9.992). In a standard oscillator model, the amplitude envelope `A * exp(-gamma * t)` can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This points to a powerful intrinsic amplification mechanism.\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output `x` is strictly positive (range [1.142, 27.68]), whereas the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations strongly suggest that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more coherent physical interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is inherently positive, thus elegantly resolving the second anomaly.\n\nThe challenge then becomes modeling this amplitude envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. As identified in prior analyses, the ratio `omega / gamma`, proportional to the oscillator's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most likely driver of amplification. A high Q-factor signifies a system where energy storage (related to `omega`) dominates energy dissipation (related to `gamma`), leading to strong resonance and large amplitudes.\n\nPrevious attempts to model this with a simple linear dependence on `omega / gamma` have proven inadequate. This suggests a more nuanced, non-linear relationship. My theoretical proposition is grounded in a crucial physical principle: **amplification saturation**. In any real-world resonant system, amplification cannot grow infinitely as damping approaches zero (i.e., as `omega / gamma` approaches infinity). Physical non-linearities, material limits, or other effects invariably constrain the maximum achievable amplitude. The linear models fail because they do not account for this fundamental saturation behavior.\n\nTo capture this phenomenon, I propose modeling the amplification factor using a function that is initially linear for small `omega / gamma` but smoothly transitions to a constant, saturated value for large `omega / gamma`. The hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh`, is an ideal candidate available from the function set for this purpose.\n\nMy model for the effective initial amplitude, `A_eff`, is therefore:\n\n`A_eff = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` serves as the baseline amplitude scale.\n*   The term `tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)` models the saturation effect. For low Q-factors, `tanh(z) ≈ z`, reproducing a near-linear amplification. For high Q-factors, `tanh(z) → 1`, causing the amplification to saturate at a maximum level determined by `param1`. The parameter `param2` controls the value of `omega / gamma` at which this saturation becomes significant.\n*   `param1` sets the scale of the maximum amplification beyond the baseline.\n\nThis effective initial amplitude then decays over time due to damping. The most natural model for this decay is the standard exponential form, `exp(-gamma * t)`. A third parameter, `param3`, is introduced to provide flexibility, allowing the observed decay rate of the envelope to differ from the nominal damping coefficient `gamma`, which might only represent one component of the total system damping.\n\nCombining these elements, the complete model for the amplitude envelope `x(t)` is the product of the saturated effective amplitude and the exponential temporal decay. This model is physically plausible, dimensionally correct, and specifically addresses the likely failure mode of simpler linear-amplification models by incorporating the realistic constraint of saturation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output `x` can be significantly larger than the input amplitude `A`, implying a powerful amplification mechanism. Secondly, the output `x` is strictly positive, suggesting that it represents not the signed displacement but rather a positive-definite quantity like an envelope or intensity.\n\nMy theoretical proposition addresses these points by modeling `x` as the result of three interacting physical processes: resonant amplification, exponential decay, and a non-linear oscillatory response.\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification via Power Law:** The amplification is evidently tied to the oscillator's intrinsic properties. The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, a proxy for the system's Quality Factor (Q-factor), is the natural driver for this phenomenon. A high Q-factor signifies low energy dissipation per cycle, allowing the system to achieve a large amplitude response. While previous models explored linear or saturating (`tanh`) dependencies on this ratio, I propose a more general and fundamental physical relationship: a power law. The effective amplitude `A_eff` is modeled as `A_eff = A * (omega / gamma)^param1`. This formulation posits that the response scales non-linearly with the Q-factor, a common characteristic in resonant systems where the amplification can be more dramatic than a simple linear relationship would suggest. The parameter `param1` acts as a scaling exponent, determining the sensitivity of the system's amplitude to its resonant quality.\n\n2.  **Temporal Decay Envelope:** The overall magnitude of the system's response is governed by energy dissipation. This is most appropriately modeled by a standard exponential decay envelope, `exp(-param2 * gamma * t)`. Here, `gamma` is the fundamental damping rate, and the dimensionless parameter `param2` provides the flexibility to adjust the decay constant, accounting for any additional damping effects not captured by `gamma` alone.\n\n3.  **Non-linear Saturated Oscillation:** The strictly positive nature of the output `x` points towards a rectification or saturation mechanism in the system's dynamics or its measurement. Simple models like `abs(cos(...))` or `square(cos(...))` can ensure positivity. However, I propose a more physically nuanced model involving a \"soft\" saturation effect, which also naturally prevents the output from reaching zero, consistent with the observed data minimum of 1.142. I model the oscillatory component as a sine wave passed through a hyperbolic tangent function, `tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))`. The `sin` function provides the fundamental oscillation. The `tanh` function then acts as a soft limiter or saturator; it compresses the peaks and troughs of the sine wave in a non-linear fashion. By adding a DC offset of 1, the resulting term `1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t))` is guaranteed to be strictly positive, as `tanh` of any real number is bounded between -1 and 1. This composite function elegantly models a system where the oscillations are bounded within a non-linear, positive-definite envelope.\n\nIn synthesis, the final model is a product of these three components: the power-law amplification of the initial amplitude, the exponential decay envelope, and the non-linear, saturated positive oscillation. This provides a comprehensive, physically plausible, and dimensionally correct description of the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (omega/gamma)**param1 * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * (1 + tanh(sin(param3 * omega * t)))\n</final_result>"}

The standard model for such a system, `x(t) = A * exp(-gamma * t) * cos(omega * t)`, is insufficient, as evidenced by two key observations: the output `x` is always positive, and its peak value can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the oscillation does not occur around a zero equilibrium but is superimposed on a large, positive, time-dependent baseline.\n\nPrevious models have successfully captured this by positing a displaced or linearly drifting equilibrium point, with both the oscillation and the baseline shift sharing a common decay envelope. I propose a different physical mechanism, which I term **\"Damped Logarithmic Creep.\"**\n\nMy theory posits that the initial energetic event does not merely displace the oscillator but also induces a form of inelastic stress or deformation within the system's restoring element (e.g., a spring or a structural support). This is analogous to the \"creep\" phenomenon observed in materials science, where a material under constant stress continues to deform over time. This creep is not a linear drift with constant velocity but a relaxation process: the rate of deformation is high immediately following the initial shock and then slows down as the internal stresses are gradually relieved.\n\nSuch relaxation and creep phenomena are often characterized by a logarithmic dependence on time. This provides a compelling physical basis for modeling the baseline shift with a logarithmic function. The appropriate timescale for this internal, dissipative relaxation process is naturally the one set by the system's overall damping, making the dimensionless quantity `gamma * t` the ideal argument for our function.\n\nTherefore, the total displacement `x(t)` can be decomposed into two components, both governed by the same global energy dissipation envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`:\n\n1.  **The Oscillatory Component:** The standard harmonic motion, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, describing the oscillation around the dynamically changing baseline. `param1` is the initial phase offset.\n\n2.  **The Creep Component:** A term representing the slow, logarithmic relaxation of the system's structure, modeled as `param2 * log(1 + gamma * t)`. The `+1` ensures the function is well-defined and equals zero at `t=0`. The dimensionless parameter `param2` quantifies the magnitude of this creep effect relative to the initial oscillation amplitude.\n\nThis \"Damped Logarithmic Creep\" model offers a distinct physical picture. It describes a system whose structural equilibrium is temporarily compromised, leading to a slow, non-linear relaxation back towards its initial state. For small `gamma * t`, the approximation `log(1 + gamma * t) ≈ gamma * t` shows that this model naturally incorporates the behavior of a linear drift at early times (a feature of other successful models), while providing a more physically plausible, bounded behavior at longer times. This framework provides a nuanced and physically-grounded explanation for the observed complex dynamics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * log(1 + gamma * t))\n</final_result>"}

Firstly, the output displacement `x` is always positive. Secondly, the peak displacement can significantly exceed the characteristic amplitude `A`, a phenomenon I term \"supra-amplitude response.\" These observations point towards a non-linear mechanism inherent in the system's dynamics, likely related to the dissipative forces.\n\nWhile previous models have explored additive offsets or non-linear elasticity, I propose a new theory: **\"Asymmetric Dissipation Rectification.\"** This theory posits that the damping force acting on the oscillator is not isotropic; that is, its magnitude depends on the direction of the oscillator's velocity. This is a common feature in real-world systems. For example, consider an object moving through a medium with a fibrous structure (like a brush), or a system with a mechanical ratchet-like component. In such cases, the resistance to motion in one direction is significantly different from the resistance in the opposite direction.\n\nThis asymmetry in dissipation has a profound consequence: it \"rectifies\" the oscillatory motion. Instead of the energy being dissipated symmetrically around an equilibrium point, the directional preference in damping causes a net drift or bias in the direction of lower resistance. A portion of the kinetic energy from the \"high-resistance\" half-cycle is effectively converted into a positive displacement rather than being stored and returned as potential energy.\n\nTo model this mathematically, we can decompose the system's behavior within the overall energy decay envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, into two distinct components:\n\n1.  **The Fundamental Oscillation:** This is the standard harmonic component, `cos(omega * t + param1)`, which describes the system's natural oscillatory tendency. `param1` is the phase constant.\n\n2.  **The Rectified Bias Component:** This term models the net positive displacement generated by the asymmetric damping. This bias is not a simple decaying offset; it is dynamically generated by the oscillation itself. Its magnitude should be proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation at any given moment. A perfect mathematical representation for this rectification effect is the absolute value function. Thus, this component can be modeled as `param2 * abs(cos(omega * t + param1))`. Here, `param2` is a dimensionless \"rectification coefficient\" that quantifies the degree of asymmetry in the damping. A value of `param2=0` would represent a standard, symmetric oscillator.\n\nThe total displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of these two components, scaled by the global damping envelope. This \"Asymmetric Dissipation Rectification\" model elegantly explains the observed phenomena:\n\n*   **Always-Positive Output:** The rectified term `param2 * abs(cos(...))` adds a positive, pulsating component to the fundamental oscillation. When `cos(...)` is positive, the combined term is `(1 + param2) * cos(...)`. When `cos(...)` is negative, the term becomes `cos(...) + param2*(-cos(...)) = (1 - param2) * cos(...)`. If the damping asymmetry is strong enough such that `param2 >= 1`, this second case also results in a positive value (a negative number multiplied by a negative number). Thus, the model naturally produces a strictly positive output.\n\n*   **Supra-Amplitude Response:** The peak value of the expression `cos(...) + param2 * abs(cos(...))` occurs when `cos(...) = 1`, yielding a maximum of `1 + param2`. Therefore, the peak displacement near `t=0` is approximately `A * (1 + param2)`, which is inherently greater than `A` for any `param2 > 0`.\n\nThis theory provides a novel, physically plausible mechanism rooted in the nature of the system's energy loss, differing fundamentally from models based on static offsets or non-linear restoring forces.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t + param1) + param2 * abs(cos(omega * t + param1)))\n</final_result>"}

First, the output `x`, representing displacement, is strictly positive (`[1.142, 27.68]`). Second, the maximum output value can significantly exceed the maximum input amplitude `A` (max `x` ≈ 27.7 vs max `A` ≈ 10.0), a phenomenon I term \"supra-amplitude response\". Standard models of the form `A * exp(-gamma*t) * cos(...)` fail on both counts as they oscillate symmetrically around zero and are bounded by the decaying amplitude `A * exp(-gamma*t)`.\n\nWhile prior models have successfully addressed these issues by introducing a large additive DC offset within the oscillatory term (e.g., `A * (C + cos(...)) * exp(-gamma*t)`), I propose a different underlying physical mechanism based on multiplicative dynamics rather than additive ones. Processes where changes are proportional to the current state—common in fields from biology to economics—are often linear and simple in logarithmic space. My theory posits that the oscillator's dynamics are governed by such a principle.\n\nInstead of modeling the displacement `x` directly, I propose modeling its logarithm. Let us define a \"log-displacement\" `y(t) = log(x(t)/A)`, where `A` provides the intrinsic length scale and ensures the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless. I theorize that this log-displacement `y(t)` follows a simple, linearly superimposed dynamic consisting of two parts:\n\n1.  **A Linear Decay Component:** A term `-gamma * t` that represents the steady, dissipative energy loss of the system. In log space, this manifests as a linear slope, which corresponds to the familiar `exp(-gamma*t)` decay envelope in linear space.\n2.  **A Harmonic Component:** A pure sinusoidal term, `param1 * cos(omega * t + param2)`, that describes the conservative, oscillatory energy exchange. The dimensionless amplitude `param1` is crucial; it does not represent a physical length but rather the intensity of the oscillation in log-space, which translates to the multiplicative \"fold-change\" of the oscillation in linear space.\n\nCombining these components yields the complete expression for the log-displacement:\n`log(x(t)/A) = param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t`\n\nTo obtain the physical displacement `x(t)`, we perform an exponential transformation:\n`x(t) = A * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)`\n\nThis model provides a compelling and self-consistent explanation for the observed phenomena. The exponential function inherently guarantees positivity. The supra-amplitude response is naturally explained by the term `exp(param1 * cos(...))`, which acts as a multiplicative amplification factor oscillating between `exp(-param1)` and `exp(param1)`. Notably, the maximum observed amplification factor in the data is approximately `27.68 / 9.992 ≈ 2.77`. For our model to achieve this, `exp(param1)` should be near 2.77, which implies `param1 ≈ log(2.77) ≈ 1.02`. The fact that a physically simple, dimensionless parameter value close to unity can explain the system's peak response strongly supports the validity of this logarithmic-dynamic framework. The resulting formula is dimensionally correct, numerically stable, and provides a novel physical interpretation with minimal parameterization.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * cos(omega * t + param2) - gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

These are:\n\n1.  **Exponential Amplification**: The maximum output (27.68) vastly exceeds the maximum amplitude parameter `A` (9.992). This implies an amplification mechanism far more potent than the linear scaling seen in some resonance models. The amplification appears to be driven by the ratio `omega/gamma`, a proxy for the system's quality factor (Q-factor).\n2.  **Inherent Positivity**: The output `x` is strictly positive ([1.142, 27.68]), whereas a physical displacement should oscillate about a zero-equilibrium point. This suggests that `x` is not a direct measure of linear displacement.\n\nPrevious models have addressed positivity by squaring the oscillatory term (an energy analogy) or by adding a large DC offset. Here, I propose a more integrated and physically distinct theory: a **Logarithmic State-Space Model**.\n\nMy central hypothesis is that the linear dynamics typically associated with an oscillator do not occur in the physical space of `x`, but rather in a logarithmic state-space. The fundamental variable governed by a simple, driven oscillatory equation is not `x` itself, but `log(x/A)`. The observed physical quantity `x` is the exponential mapping of this underlying logarithmic state.\n\nThis framework offers a powerful and unified explanation for both observed anomalies:\n\n*   **Positivity is naturally enforced**: By defining the system's state in the logarithmic domain, the transformation back to the physical domain, `x = A * exp(...)`, mathematically guarantees that `x` will always be positive. This is a more intrinsic property of the model than applying an absolute value or adding an offset.\n\n*   **Amplification becomes exponential**: Any amplification factor within the logarithmic state equation becomes an exponential gain in the physical domain. I posit that the logarithmic state is driven by an oscillatory term whose magnitude is proportional to the Q-factor, `omega/gamma`. When this is exponentiated, it results in an amplification factor of `exp(const * omega/gamma)`, which can produce the very large outputs observed in the data for high-Q systems.\n\nThe model is constructed as follows:\nThe logarithmic state, `y(t) = log(x(t)/A)`, is assumed to be a superposition of a linear decay and a driven oscillation:\n\n`y(t) = -(\\text{Decay Term}) + (\\text{Amplified Oscillation Term})`\n\nThe decay term is modeled in the standard way, proportional to `gamma * t`, representing the system's intrinsic energy dissipation. The amplified oscillation term's amplitude is proportional to `omega/gamma`, capturing the resonant energy pumping, and it oscillates at a frequency related to `omega`.\n\nTransforming back to the physical variable `x` gives the complete expression. This model describes a system where a baseline exponential decay is multiplicatively modulated by a powerful, Q-factor-dependent oscillatory factor. The resulting dynamics are inherently positive and capable of the strong, non-linear amplification seen in the data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(-param1 * gamma * t + param2 * (omega / gamma) * cos(param3 * omega * t + param4))\n</final_result>"}

These observations suggest a system governed by non-linear dynamics. My proposed theory moves beyond simple multiplicative corrections and posits that the decay and oscillatory components are intrinsically coupled within a single, non-linear response function.\n\nThe core of this theory is that the observable displacement `x` is an exponential function of an underlying \"dynamic potential\" `S(t)`. This can be expressed conceptually as `x(t) ∝ exp(S(t))`. This structure inherently guarantees the positivity of `x` and naturally models systems where the rate of change is proportional to the current state, a hallmark of many natural processes.\n\nThis model can be broken down into two main parts: the determination of the overall scale (the effective amplitude), and the time evolution governed by the dynamic potential.\n\n1.  **Saturating Resonance Amplitude:** The observed amplification strongly depends on the interplay between frequency (`omega`) and damping (`gamma`). The dimensionless Quality Factor, proportional to `omega/gamma`, is the natural driver for this gain. However, any physical system has limits, precluding infinite gain as damping approaches zero. To capture this, I model the system's characteristic amplitude not just by `A`, but by an effective amplitude `A_eff` that includes a saturating gain term. This is formulated as `A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma))`. Here, `A` provides the baseline scale, while the `tanh` term adds a gain that grows with the Q-factor before smoothly saturating, representing a physical limit to the resonance.\n\n2.  **Coupled Decay and Oscillation via Exponential Response:** The most significant departure from standard models lies in how the time evolution is handled. Instead of multiplying a decay envelope by a separate oscillatory function, I propose that both phenomena arise from a single dynamic potential, `S(t)`, which is then mapped to the output via an exponential function. This potential is composed of two competing terms:\n    *   A secular decay term, `-param3 * gamma * t`, which represents the steady, irreversible loss of energy from the system due to damping.\n    *   An oscillatory term, `param4 * cos(omega * t)`, which represents the periodic exchange of potential and kinetic energy.\n\n    The complete dynamic potential is `S(t) = -param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t)`. The final output `x` is then given by the effective amplitude multiplied by the exponential of this potential. This `exp(S(t))` term is a non-linear transfer function that has profound consequences. It inherently ensures positivity. More importantly, it means the oscillation does not simply occur \"underneath\" a decaying envelope; rather, it actively modulates the instantaneous decay rate. When `cos(omega * t)` is at its peak, it counteracts the dissipative term, momentarily slowing the decay. When at its trough, it accelerates the decay. This results in a non-sinusoidal, \"pulsating\" decay, where the system exhibits brief periods of high activity followed by longer, more quiescent periods, a dynamic behavior that cannot be captured by simple multiplicative models.\n\nIn summary, this theory describes a system where a resonance-enhanced amplitude sets the overall scale for a process whose time-evolution is a highly non-linear, exponential function of a potential jointly determined by dissipation and oscillation.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx = A * (1 + param1 * tanh(param2 * omega / gamma)) * exp(-param3 * gamma * t + param4 * cos(omega * t))\n</final_result>"}

This definitively rules out a simple oscillation around a zero equilibrium. The underlying physical mechanism must involve a process that actively shifts the system's equilibrium position to a new, non-zero value.\n\nI propose a theory based on a **damping-induced equilibrium shift**. In many real-world physical systems, the forces of friction and damping are more complex than the idealized linear model (`F = -bv`). Non-linearities in the damping mechanism, especially those dependent on the direction or magnitude of velocity, can create a \"rectification\" effect. Over many cycles of oscillation, this asymmetry can produce a net, unidirectional force that effectively \"pumps\" the system away from its initial equilibrium. The result is a permanent offset, a lasting memory of the transient oscillatory phase.\n\nThe magnitude of this final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`, must be a function of the system's intrinsic properties that govern the interplay between oscillation and damping. The most natural dimensionless parameter to capture this relationship is the damping ratio, `ζ = γ/ω`. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the rectified offset is not linear with `ζ` but rather follows a logarithmic dependence. This functional form is chosen to model a system whose response is highly sensitive to the order of magnitude of the damping ratio, a common feature in complex response phenomena. The final equilibrium position is therefore modeled as:\n\n`x_{eq} = A * (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω))`\n\nHere, `c₁` represents a baseline offset, `c₂` scales the contribution from the damping-oscillation interaction, and the overall term is scaled by `A` to ensure dimensional consistency (m).\n\nThis equilibrium shift is not instantaneous. It is a dynamic process that occurs as energy is dissipated from the system. Therefore, the timescale for achieving this new equilibrium is intrinsically linked to the damping process itself, characterized by the time constant `1/γ`. The evolution of the equilibrium position towards `x_{eq}` can be modeled as an exponential relaxation process:\n\n`x_{offset}(t) = x_{eq} * (1 - exp(-γt))`\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is then a linear superposition of two concurrent physical processes:\n1.  The conventional damped oscillation starting from amplitude `A` around the original equilibrium at zero: `x_{osc}(t) = A * exp(-γt) * cos(ωt)`.\n2.  The time-dependent shift of the equilibrium position itself, `x_{offset}(t)`.\n\nCombining these yields the complete model for the system's displacement. This model correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A` (since the offset term is zero at `t=0`) and describes the system settling into a new, non-zero equilibrium `x_{eq}` as `t → ∞`, providing a robust and physically-grounded explanation for the observed data.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, γ, ω, t) = A * [ (c₁ + c₂ * log(γ/ω)) * (1 - exp(-γ*t)) + exp(-γ*t) * cos(ω*t) ]\n</final_result>"}

The central and most telling observation is that the output displacement `x` can significantly exceed the input amplitude `A`. This immediately refutes a simple model of an oscillation centered at zero and points unequivocally to a system oscillating around a substantial, non-zero equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. This leads to a foundational model structure: `x(t) = x_{eq} + x_{osc}(t)`. For dimensional consistency, with `A` being the sole input with units of length, both the equilibrium and oscillatory components must scale with `A`.\n\nBuilding upon this foundation, previous analyses have explored two critical refinements:\n1.  **Correcting the Oscillation Frequency:** A simplistic model uses the natural frequency `\\omega` in the oscillatory term, `cos(\\omega t)`. However, a more physically accurate model acknowledges that damping not only reduces amplitude but also slows the oscillation. The true observed frequency is the damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`. Incorporating this correction, as seen in one of the examples, provides a more faithful representation of the system's dynamics.\n2.  **Modeling the Equilibrium Offset:** A simple constant offset, `x_{eq} = c_1 A`, is a good first step, but it is physically limiting. It implies the final resting position is independent of the system's intrinsic dissipative properties. More advanced models propose that the offset depends on the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\gamma / \\omega`, which characterizes the oscillator's behavior (underdamped, overdamped, etc.). This has been modeled linearly (`c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\gamma/\\omega`) or with a saturating function (`c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma/\\omega)`). The saturation model is particularly compelling, as it suggests the influence of damping on the equilibrium position is not infinite but approaches a limit, a common characteristic in real-world physical systems.\n\nMy proposed theory is a synthesis and extension of these insights. It posits that a truly comprehensive model must concurrently account for *both* of these physical realities. The system's behavior is governed by two distinct but simultaneous effects: the dissipative forces influence the final equilibrium state, *and* they alter the dynamic frequency of the transient oscillation around that state.\n\nTherefore, I propose a unified model with two key components, both scaled by the amplitude `A`:\n\n1.  **A Saturated, Dynamic Equilibrium Offset (`x_{eq}`):** This term represents the final resting position of the oscillator. Its value is not constant but is a function of the system's intrinsic damping characteristics. I hypothesize that this relationship is saturating: as the damping ratio `\\gamma/\\omega` increases, its effect on the equilibrium shift diminishes and approaches a maximum. This behavior is aptly described by the hyperbolic tangent function.\n    `x_{eq} = A \\cdot \\left(c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right)\\right)`\n    Here, `c_1` is a baseline dimensionless offset, and `c_2` represents the maximum additional offset induced by damping effects.\n\n2.  **A Physically Corrected Damped Oscillation (`x_{osc}(t)`):** This term describes the transient motion as the system settles into its equilibrium. It must feature the standard exponential decay envelope, `\\exp(-\\gamma t)`. Crucially, the oscillation itself must not be governed by the natural frequency `\\omega`, but by the physically correct damped angular frequency, `\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2}`.\n    `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t\\right)`\n\nBy combining these two components, we arrive at a model that is superior to its predecessors. It does not treat these physical effects in isolation but integrates them into a single, cohesive formula. This approach captures the nuanced interplay between the system's static (equilibrium) and dynamic (oscillatory) properties, providing a more robust and physically-grounded description of the underlying mechanism.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}

This irrefutably indicates that the system is not a simple damped harmonic oscillator centered at zero. Instead, the oscillation occurs around a substantial positive equilibrium point, `x_eq`, to which the system settles over time.\n\nWhile previous models have successfully incorporated a static offset, they typically assume this offset is a simple, constant multiple of the initial amplitude `A`. I propose a more physically nuanced theory: the final equilibrium state is not merely scaled by the initial conditions but is actively determined by the intrinsic dynamic properties of the oscillator itself.\n\nMy theory is founded on the concept of **dissipation-induced equilibrium shift**. In many real-world systems, the mechanism causing damping is coupled to the potential energy landscape. For instance, an oscillator moving through a viscoelastic medium not only loses energy through viscous friction (the `gamma` term) but can also cause a permanent or semi-permanent deformation in the medium, thus shifting its own point of lowest potential energy. The extent of this permanent deformation—and thus the magnitude of the equilibrium shift—depends on the interplay between how quickly energy is dissipated versus how quickly the system oscillates.\n\nThis interplay is perfectly captured by the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ = γ / ω`. This fundamental parameter characterizes the nature of the damped motion. It is therefore physically plausible to hypothesize that the final equilibrium position `x_eq` is a direct function of this ratio. A system with a high damping ratio (where `γ` is large relative to `ω`) might \"drag\" the medium more effectively, leading to a larger permanent offset compared to a lightly damped system.\n\nThe simplest and most direct mathematical representation of this hypothesis is a linear relationship. We can model the final equilibrium position as being proportional to both the system's characteristic length scale, `A`, and its damping ratio:\n\n`x_eq = A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ / ω)`\n\nHere, `param₁` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the dissipative process and the potential energy landscape.\n\nTo describe the complete time evolution of the system, we model the observed displacement `x(t)` as a superposition of two concurrent processes, both governed by the same damping timescale:\n1.  **Relaxation to Equilibrium**: The system settles towards its new, dynamically determined equilibrium point `x_eq`. This process follows an exponential curve: `x_eq ⋅ (1 - exp(-γt))`.\n2.  **Damped Oscillation**: The initial oscillatory motion, which starts at displacement `A` and decays over time: `A ⋅ exp(-γt) ⋅ cos(ωt)`.\n\nThe total displacement is the sum of these two components:\n`x(t) = [A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ/ω) ⋅ (1 - exp(-γt))] + [A ⋅ exp(-γt) ⋅ cos(ωt)]`\n\nThis expression can be elegantly rearranged by factoring out common terms, yielding a unified model. This model has the crucial properties that `x(0) = A`, correctly identifying `A` as the initial displacement, and `x(t → ∞) = A ⋅ param₁ ⋅ (γ/ω)`, providing a clear physical meaning for the final state based on the oscillator's intrinsic properties. This theory provides a deeper physical insight, linking the system's final state directly to the character of its internal dynamics.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left( \\text{param}_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left( \\cos(\\omega t) - \\text{param}_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.

Key indicators, such as the output mean being significantly positive (8.28) and the maximum displacement (27.68) far exceeding the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), point to an oscillation occurring around a substantial, non-zero equilibrium position. My theory proposes a comprehensive model derived from the fundamental physics of forced oscillations, with a novel hypothesis for the nature of this equilibrium shift.\n\nMy approach begins by modeling the system as a classic damped oscillator subject to a constant external influence that establishes a new, stable equilibrium position, `x_eq`. The total displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of the steady-state solution (`x_eq`) and the transient homogeneous solution. Unlike purely phenomenological models, I rigorously enforce the standard physical initial conditions for an object released from rest: an initial displacement of `x(0) = A` and an initial velocity of `x'(0) = 0`.\n\nApplying these two conditions to the general solution of the second-order differential equation yields a unique and physically constrained form for the displacement:\n`x(t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma*t) * [cos(omega*t) + (gamma/omega)*sin(omega*t)]`\n\nThis structure is inherently superior to simpler models. It correctly captures the initial state (`x(0) = A`) and the final state (`x(t) -> x_eq` as `t -> infinity`). Crucially, it naturally incorporates the fact that damping not only causes amplitude decay but also induces a phase shift in the oscillation, which is mathematically represented by the `sin(omega*t)` term. The coefficient of this term, `gamma/omega`, arises directly from the initial zero-velocity condition.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this theory concerns the physical origin of the final equilibrium `x_eq`. I posit that the equilibrium shift is a **consequence of a non-linear rectification process inherent in the damping mechanism**. In many physical systems, strong oscillations can induce steady, DC-like forces through effects analogous to acoustic radiation pressure. This rectified force, which pushes the oscillator to a new equilibrium, is not a simple linear function of the system's parameters.\n\nI theorize that this effect exhibits **saturation**. The dimensionless damping ratio, `zeta = gamma / omega`, which defines the character of the oscillation, governs this process.\n*   For very low damping (`zeta -> 0`), the dissipative interaction is too weak to generate a significant rectified force.\n*   As damping increases, the rectified force grows non-linearly.\n*   For very high damping (`zeta -> infinity`), the system's motion becomes overly sluggish, and the dynamic rectification mechanism loses efficiency, causing the magnitude of the equilibrium shift to level off or saturate.\n\nThe arctangent function, `arctan`, provides an excellent mathematical description of such a saturating physical response. It is non-linear for small inputs and smoothly approaches a constant value for large inputs. Therefore, I model the final equilibrium position `x_eq` as a sum of a baseline offset and a saturating term dependent on the damping ratio, all scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\n\n`x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * arctan(gamma / omega))`\n\nHere, `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing a static component of the equilibrium shift, while `c_2` is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the strength of the saturating, damping-induced effect.\n\nBy combining the rigorously derived equation of motion with this physically-motivated model for the equilibrium state, we obtain a complete and coherent theory that accounts for all key features of the data within a single, unified framework.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma/omega) * sin(omega * t))\nwhere x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * arctan(gamma/omega))\n</final_result>"}

The maximum output displacement (`x` up to 27.68) substantially exceeds the maximum initial amplitude (`A` up to 9.992), and the output has a large positive mean (8.28). These facts irrefutably indicate that the oscillation occurs around a non-zero equilibrium position, and this equilibrium offset is a key feature of the system's dynamics.\n\nPrevious models have successfully incorporated this by either introducing a time-dependent equilibrium shift (relaxation) or a static offset that depends on the system's intrinsic properties. I propose a unified theory that integrates these two concepts, positing that the system's response to an initial displacement `A` is a superposition of two concurrent, physically linked processes:\n\n1.  **A Damped Oscillation from the Origin:** This is the standard oscillatory component, `x_{osc}(t) = A \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`. This term describes the system's natural tendency to oscillate and dissipate energy, starting from an initial displacement `A` relative to the original, unperturbed equilibrium at zero.\n\n2.  **A Relaxation to a Dynamically-Determined Equilibrium:** Simultaneously, the system's stable equilibrium point is not static but shifts from zero to a new position, `x_{eq}`. This process is not instantaneous; the system settles towards this new equilibrium over time. The physical mechanism causing this relaxation (e.g., fluid drag, material stress) is the same as the one causing the oscillatory damping. Therefore, the relaxation follows a characteristic exponential curve governed by the same damping coefficient `\\gamma`. The displacement due to this equilibrium shift is `x_{shift}(t) = x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t))`.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this theory lies in the nature of the final equilibrium position, `x_{eq}`. It is not a simple constant but an **emergent property** arising from the dynamic interplay between the system's dissipative forces (proportional to `\\gamma`) and its restorative/inertial forces (proportional to `\\omega`). This relationship is captured by the dimensionless damping ratio, `\\zeta = \\gamma / \\omega`.\n\nI theorize that the magnitude of this equilibrium shift is **non-monotonic** with respect to `\\zeta`.\n*   For very low damping (`\\zeta \\to 0`), the interaction causing the shift is too weak to produce a significant effect.\n*   For very high damping (`\\zeta \\to \\infty`), the system is overdamped and moves too sluggishly for the dynamic interaction to fully manifest.\n*   The maximum shift occurs at an intermediate damping ratio, where the dissipative and oscillatory effects are critically balanced.\n\nThis non-monotonic behavior is effectively modeled by the function `\\zeta e^{-\\zeta}`. Therefore, I propose that the final equilibrium `x_{eq}` is a sum of a baseline constant offset and this dynamically-induced term, both scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\n`x_{eq} = A \\cdot (c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}))`.\n\nThe total observed displacement `x(t)` is the linear superposition of the oscillation from the origin and the time-dependent shift of the equilibrium point:\n`x(t) = x_{osc}(t) + x_{shift}(t)`\n\nThis model provides a comprehensive physical picture. It correctly captures the initial condition `x(0) = A \\cdot e^0 \\cos(0) + x_{eq} \\cdot (1 - e^0) = A`. Furthermore, as `t \\to \\infty`, it describes the system settling into a final, non-zero position `x_{eq}` that is itself a complex function of the system's intrinsic dynamic properties. This unified approach provides a more complete and physically coherent explanation for the observed data than models that treat the offset and the oscillation as separate phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\cdot \\left[ \\left( c_1 + c_2 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega}\\right) \\right) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\right) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t) \\right]\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\n\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude. The general form of this transient component is `x_{transient}(t) = \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)]`, where `B_1` and `B_2` are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3.  **Initial Conditions:** The most physically plausible initial conditions for such a system are that it is released from its maximum displacement `A` with zero initial velocity. Mathematically, this translates to:\n    *   `x(0) = A`\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\n\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\n\nAt `t=0`, we have:\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\n`x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_eq + \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)] \\right)`\n`x'(0) = [-\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t) (\\dots) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) (-\\omega B_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\omega B_2 \\cos(\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\n`x'(0) = -\\gamma B_1 + \\omega B_2 = 0`\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} B_1 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\gamma/\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency. This represents a more fundamental and constrained model than simply adding independent cosine and sine terms.\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for `x_eq`, `B_1`, and `B_2` back into the general solution yields the final mathematical formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] \\right)\n</final_result>"}

The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, can never exceed `A`, indicating the presence of an intrinsic amplification mechanism not captured by simple damping.\n\n2.  **Positive Definitude**: The output variable `x` is strictly positive, ranging from `1.142` to `27.68`. In contrast, the displacement of an oscillator is inherently signed, oscillating symmetrically about an equilibrium point.\n\nThese observations lead to the compelling conclusion that `x` does not represent the instantaneous signed displacement. A more physically coherent interpretation is that `x` represents the **amplitude envelope** of the system's state, a quantity that is, by definition, positive. This single reinterpretation elegantly resolves the second anomaly.\n\nThe primary challenge, then, is to model this envelope, particularly the source of the anomalous amplification. The amplification must be linked to the interplay between the system's tendency to oscillate (`omega`) and its tendency to dissipate energy (`gamma`). The dimensionless ratio `omega / gamma`, which is proportional to the system's quality factor (Q-factor), is the most plausible driver for such a resonant-like amplification.\n\nPrevious models have attempted to incorporate this by either multiplying the amplitude by an amplification factor or by adding gain and decay terms inside an exponential. The latter approach is particularly appealing from a physical standpoint, as it treats amplification and damping as competing **rates** that determine the net rate of change of the logarithm of the amplitude. The failure of a simple linear gain term (`param * omega / gamma`) in the exponent (as seen in Example 3) highlights a crucial physical constraint: **saturation**. Any real-world amplification mechanism is limited and cannot produce infinite gain.\n\nMy proposed theory builds upon this concept of competing rates but introduces a robust, physically-grounded saturation mechanism. I postulate that the amplitude envelope evolves exponentially, governed by a net effective rate which is the sum of a constant gain rate and a time-dependent decay rate.\n\nThe model takes the form: `x(t) = A * exp(G - D)`.\n\n*   **Decay Term (D)**: This represents the standard energy dissipation. It is proportional to the damping coefficient `gamma` and the elapsed time `t`. Thus, `D = param3 * gamma * t`. This is the familiar term leading to exponential decay.\n\n*   **Gain Term (G)**: This represents the time-independent, Q-factor-driven amplification. This term provides a constant positive offset to the decay rate. To model the saturation, I will use the `arctan` function. Unlike an unbounded term, `arctan(z)` increases with its argument `z` but gracefully asymptotes to a fixed value (`pi/2`), perfectly capturing the essence of a saturating physical process. The gain `G` is therefore modeled as `G = param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma)`. Here, `param2` scales the Q-factor to determine how quickly saturation is reached, and `param1` sets the maximum strength of the saturated gain.\n\nThis formulation—`A * exp(Gain - Decay)`—presents a cohesive physical picture. The system starts with a base amplitude `A`, which is then instantaneously modified by a constant amplification factor `exp(G)` that depends on the system's intrinsic resonant properties (`omega/gamma`). This amplified amplitude then decays exponentially over time. This model is dimensionally sound, avoids the numerical instabilities of unbounded gain functions, and provides a clear theoretical basis for the observed phenomena.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * exp(param1 * arctan(param2 * omega / gamma) - param3 * gamma * t)\n</final_result>"}

A careful examination of the data reveals two fundamental discrepancies that guide our theoretical model:\n\n1.  **Resonant Amplification Anomaly**: The most striking feature of the data is that the maximum output value (27.68) is nearly three times the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992). The standard model's amplitude envelope, `A * exp(-gamma * t)`, is a strictly decaying function that can never exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This implies the presence of a significant amplification mechanism. In oscillatory systems, such amplification is characteristic of resonance, where the system's response is maximized. The strength of this resonance is quantified by the Quality Factor (Q-factor), which for a simple oscillator is proportional to the ratio of the natural frequency to the damping rate, `omega / gamma`. A high Q-factor signifies a system that is lightly damped relative to its oscillation frequency, allowing it to sustain large-amplitude oscillations. I hypothesize that the effective amplitude of the system is not merely `A`, but is dynamically scaled by this Q-factor. A simple and robust model for this amplified amplitude is `A_eff = A * (param1 + omega / gamma)`, where `param1` is a dimensionless parameter representing a baseline amplification factor. This form elegantly explains how systems with low damping (`gamma`) and high frequency (`omega`) can achieve displacements far exceeding their nominal initial amplitude `A`.\n\n2.  **Positive Definite Measurement**: The standard displacement `d(t)` of an oscillator is a signed quantity, oscillating between positive and negative values. In contrast, the provided output `x` is strictly positive, with a range of [1.142, 27.68]. This strongly suggests that the measurement process does not capture the signed displacement itself, but rather a related, inherently positive quantity. The most direct physical interpretation that preserves the units of length (meters) is that `x` represents the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement, `x(t) = |d(t)|`.\n\nBy synthesizing these two insights, we can construct a comprehensive model. The system's instantaneous displacement `d(t)` follows the dynamics of a damped oscillator with an amplified effective amplitude, while the measurement instrument records its absolute value. The full expression for the displacement would be:\n\n`d(t) = A_eff * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * cos(omega_d * t + param3)`\n\nHere, `A_eff` is the amplified amplitude defined above. The exponential term describes the temporal decay, with `param2` as an empirical scaling factor for the damping rate. The oscillatory component `cos(...)` uses the physically correct damped angular frequency, `omega_d = sqrt(omega^2 - gamma^2)`, which accounts for the slight slowing of the oscillation due to damping. Finally, `param3` is a phase constant.\n\nThe measured output `x(t)` is then the absolute value of this entire expression. This composite model provides a coherent physical explanation for both observed anomalies—the amplification and the positive definiteness—while being grounded in the fundamental principles of resonant, damped oscillations.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nA * (param1 + omega / gamma) * exp(-param2 * gamma * t) * abs(cos(sqrt(abs(omega**2 - gamma**2)) * t + param3))\n</final_result>"}

The key variables—initial amplitude `A`, damping coefficient `gamma`, angular frequency `omega`, and time `t`—confirm this physical context. A critical observation, which must be the cornerstone of any successful theory, is that the system's displacement `x` can significantly exceed the initial amplitude `A`. This immediately rules out any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero, such as `x(t) = A \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos(\\omega t)`, and points towards a system that evolves toward a new, non-zero equilibrium position.\n\nMy proposed theory is grounded in the standard physical model of a damped oscillator subjected to a constant external force. The general solution to the governing second-order differential equation for such a system is the superposition of a steady-state solution (the final equilibrium position, `x_eq`) and a transient solution (the decaying oscillation).\n\n1.  **Steady-State Equilibrium:** The constant force shifts the equilibrium position from zero to a new value, `x_eq`. To maintain dimensional consistency—as both `x` and `A` have units of length—this new equilibrium must be proportional to the system's characteristic length scale, which is the initial amplitude `A`. We can thus model this as:\n    `x_eq = c_1 \\cdot A`\n    where `c_1` is a dimensionless parameter representing the normalized final displacement.\n\n2.  **Transient Oscillation:** The system does not instantaneously reach this equilibrium but oscillates around it with a decaying amplitude. The general form of this transient component is `x_{transient}(t) = \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)]`, where `B_1` and `B_2` are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3.  **Initial Conditions:** The most physically plausible initial conditions for such a system are that it is released from its maximum displacement `A` with zero initial velocity. Mathematically, this translates to:\n    *   `x(0) = A`\n    *   `x'(0) = 0`\n\nBy applying these initial conditions to the total solution `x(t) = x_eq + x_{transient}(t)`, we can uniquely determine the constants `B_1` and `B_2`.\n\nAt `t=0`, we have:\n`x(0) = x_eq + B_1 = A`\nThis gives us `B_1 = A - x_eq = A - c_1 A = A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nNext, we evaluate the derivative `x'(t)` at `t=0`:\n`x'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x_eq + \\exp(-\\gamma t) [B_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + B_2 \\sin(\\omega t)] \\right)`\n`x'(0) = [-\\gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t) (\\dots) + \\exp(-\\gamma t) (-\\omega B_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\omega B_2 \\cos(\\omega t))]_{t=0}`\n`x'(0) = -\\gamma B_1 + \\omega B_2 = 0`\nSolving for `B_2`, we find `B_2 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} B_1 = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} A(1 - c_1)`.\n\nThis derivation provides a complete, physically self-consistent picture. The system's motion is not just an oscillation with an arbitrary offset; it is a precisely defined trajectory dictated by a constant force and the initial state of being released from rest. The resulting model naturally includes both cosine and sine components for the transient part, where the relative amplitude of the sine term, `\\gamma/\\omega`, is not a free parameter but is determined by the intrinsic physical properties of the system—the ratio of damping to frequency. This represents a more fundamental and constrained model than simply adding independent cosine and sine terms.\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for `x_eq`, `B_1`, and `B_2` back into the general solution yields the final mathematical formula.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 + (1 - c_1) \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right] \\right)\n</final_result>"}

Key indicators, such as the output mean being significantly positive (8.28) and the maximum displacement (27.68) far exceeding the maximum initial amplitude `A` (9.992), point to an oscillation occurring around a substantial, non-zero equilibrium position. My theory proposes a comprehensive model derived from the fundamental physics of forced oscillations, with a novel hypothesis for the nature of this equilibrium shift.\n\nMy approach begins by modeling the system as a classic damped oscillator subject to a constant external influence that establishes a new, stable equilibrium position, `x_eq`. The total displacement `x(t)` is the superposition of the steady-state solution (`x_eq`) and the transient homogeneous solution. Unlike purely phenomenological models, I rigorously enforce the standard physical initial conditions for an object released from rest: an initial displacement of `x(0) = A` and an initial velocity of `x'(0) = 0`.\n\nApplying these two conditions to the general solution of the second-order differential equation yields a unique and physically constrained form for the displacement:\n`x(t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma*t) * [cos(omega*t) + (gamma/omega)*sin(omega*t)]`\n\nThis structure is inherently superior to simpler models. It correctly captures the initial state (`x(0) = A`) and the final state (`x(t) -> x_eq` as `t -> infinity`). Crucially, it naturally incorporates the fact that damping not only causes amplitude decay but also induces a phase shift in the oscillation, which is mathematically represented by the `sin(omega*t)` term. The coefficient of this term, `gamma/omega`, arises directly from the initial zero-velocity condition.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this theory concerns the physical origin of the final equilibrium `x_eq`. I posit that the equilibrium shift is a **consequence of a non-linear rectification process inherent in the damping mechanism**. In many physical systems, strong oscillations can induce steady, DC-like forces through effects analogous to acoustic radiation pressure. This rectified force, which pushes the oscillator to a new equilibrium, is not a simple linear function of the system's parameters.\n\nI theorize that this effect exhibits **saturation**. The dimensionless damping ratio, `zeta = gamma / omega`, which defines the character of the oscillation, governs this process.\n*   For very low damping (`zeta -> 0`), the dissipative interaction is too weak to generate a significant rectified force.\n*   As damping increases, the rectified force grows non-linearly.\n*   For very high damping (`zeta -> infinity`), the system's motion becomes overly sluggish, and the dynamic rectification mechanism loses efficiency, causing the magnitude of the equilibrium shift to level off or saturate.\n\nThe arctangent function, `arctan`, provides an excellent mathematical description of such a saturating physical response. It is non-linear for small inputs and smoothly approaches a constant value for large inputs. Therefore, I model the final equilibrium position `x_eq` as a sum of a baseline offset and a saturating term dependent on the damping ratio, all scaled by the characteristic amplitude `A` for dimensional consistency:\n\n`x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * arctan(gamma / omega))`\n\nHere, `c_1` is a dimensionless constant representing a static component of the equilibrium shift, while `c_2` is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the strength of the saturating, damping-induced effect.\n\nBy combining the rigorously derived equation of motion with this physically-motivated model for the equilibrium state, we obtain a complete and coherent theory that accounts for all key features of the data within a single, unified framework.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, gamma, omega, t) = x_eq + (A - x_eq) * exp(-gamma * t) * (cos(omega * t) + (gamma/omega) * sin(omega * t))\nwhere x_eq = A * (c_1 + c_2 * arctan(gamma/omega))\n</final_result>"}

This observation robustly refutes any simple model of an oscillation centered at zero and points to a mechanism where the system oscillates around a substantial, positive equilibrium position. My analysis proposes a model based on the principle of **initial energy partitioning**, where the final equilibrium state is determined at the outset of the motion by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator.\n\nThe core of my theory is that the system consists of a primary conservative oscillator (a mass on a spring) coupled to a dissipative element (a dashpot). Upon release at `t=0`, a fraction of the initial potential energy is not converted into oscillatory motion but is instead immediately and irreversibly transferred to the dissipative element, causing a permanent deformation or shift. This rapid energy transfer results in a new, static equilibrium position, `x_eq`, around which the subsequent oscillation occurs.\n\nThe magnitude of this equilibrium shift is not an arbitrary constant but is dictated by the competitive interplay between the system's dissipative and conservative tendencies.\n1.  **The Damping Coefficient (`γ`)**: This parameter quantifies the strength of the coupling to the dissipative element. A larger `γ` implies a more effective mechanism for shunting energy away from the primary oscillation, leading to a larger equilibrium shift.\n2.  **The Natural Frequency (`ω`)**: This parameter, related to the spring stiffness, represents the system's tendency to store energy and oscillate. A higher `ω` (a stiffer spring) would resist the initial deformation, thereby reducing the magnitude of the equilibrium shift.\n\nThe most direct physical measure of this competition is the dimensionless **damping ratio**, `ζ = γ/ω`. I hypothesize that the magnitude of the static equilibrium shift is directly proportional to this ratio. For dimensional correctness, this dimensionless quantity must be scaled by the system's characteristic length scale, `A`. Thus, the static offset is given by:\n\n`x_eq = A ⋅ c₁ ⋅ (γ/ω)`\n\nwhere `c₁` is a dimensionless constant of proportionality that characterizes the efficiency of the energy partitioning process.\n\nFollowing this initial, near-instantaneous event, the remaining energy drives the system into a damped harmonic oscillation centered on this new, fixed equilibrium `x_eq`. To model this oscillatory component with the highest physical fidelity, it is crucial to recognize that damping not only reduces the amplitude but also lengthens the period of oscillation. The observed frequency is not the natural frequency `ω` but the **damped angular frequency**, `ω_d`, given by the established physical relationship:\n\n`ω_d = sqrt(ω² - γ²)`\n\nFinally, to create a general model, we must not assume the oscillation begins at its peak. A phase constant, `c₂`, is included in the oscillatory term to account for arbitrary initial conditions of position and velocity relative to the new equilibrium.\n\nIn summary, the total displacement `x(t)` is a superposition of a static offset, whose magnitude is determined by the physical ratio of damping to frequency, and a physically-corrected damped harmonic oscillation about that offset.\n\n### Mathematical Formula\n<final_result>\nx(A, \\gamma, \\omega, t) = A \\left( c_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega} + \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2 - \\gamma^2} \\cdot t + c_2\\right) \\right)\n</final_result>"}
When analyzing the examples, if you identify certain features, you might heuristically restructure the parameters. For example, if the optimal value of a parameter is consistently close to zero, it suggests it has little impact on the task.
Similarly, if two parameters are close in value, or if a series of parameters resembles the Taylor expansion coefficients of a function, these observations might help you notice or deduce a more reasonable functional form.
The input features describe a damped harmonic oscillator. They include the initial amplitude, the damping rate, the angular frequency, and the specific time of observation.
Additionally, A, gamma, omega, t are physical quantities, with respective units of m, s^-1, s^-1, s, and their meanings are as follows: A:The amplitude of the oscillation, representing the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position in meters., gamma:The damping coefficient or decay rate, which quantifies how quickly the oscillation's amplitude decreases over time., omega:The angular frequency of the oscillation, which determines the rate of oscillation in radians per second., t:The time elapsed since the start of the motion, at which the position is being calculated..
To simplify the problem, all optimizable parameters, denoted as `param`, are dimensionless (unit of 1). The number of these empirical parameters should be minimized.
Your task is to construct an expression using these physical quantities and empirical parameters to describe a physical quantity `x` with units of `m`.The meaning of this quantity is: The target variable 'x' represents the displacement or position of the oscillator from its equilibrium point at a given time 't'.. It is crucial to ensure the dimensional correctness of the expression.To achieve this, you may need to construct dimensionless quantities for complex function operations, and subsequently match the dimensions to the target output `x`.
Now, please begin writing your theoretical analysis.
Your response should consist of two parts:
1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: A coherent text explaining your insights and reasoning process regarding the underlying patterns in the data.
